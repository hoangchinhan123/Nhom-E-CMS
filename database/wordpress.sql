I applaud so much of how all of these things have simplified my life, and make my life so much easier as a disabled person. I use <strong>Ring</strong> doorbell to talk to anyone who rings my doorbell to let them know I’m on my way (but slow). I use <strong>Alexa</strong> to automate lights when I’m not home and voice commands to turn on/off lights, check the weather and news, and set my thermostat. This week I installed a <strong>Stream Deck</strong> to automate things at my desk like key lights, opening websites, and I even added a sound for podcasting fun. AI can generate copy for titles, tweets, and even site content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But nothing surpasses human interaction. Being on a <strong>Zoom</strong> call for our Post Status weekly huddles, creative brainstorming with my <strong>Stellar</strong> team, one-on-ones with friends and family, and recording podcasts with my podcasting partners and guests all enhance my life greatly. And I appreciate interacting with so many of you on <strong>Twitter</strong> about <strong>WordPress</strong>, tech, and life in general.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/28/23428132/elon-musk-twitter-acquisition-problems-speech-moderation\">Changes are coming to Twitter with the new leadership there</a>.

This is another major step towards seeing artificial intelligence integrated into the WordPress stack. I have not taken it for a spin yet but intend to kick the tires around this weekend to conjure up some spooky hellscapes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-your-blocks-are-scaring-the-children\">Your Blocks Are Scaring The Children</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Post Status members <strong>Roy Sivan</strong> and <strong>James Tryon</strong> have been working on their own suite of design tools for the <strong>Block Editor</strong> lovingly called <a href=\"https://blockstyles.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Block Styles</a>. Recently they’ve been on fire with so many updates and new features that it’s hard not to be excited. For me, the responsive tools alone are the killer feature that I needed. I’ve tried so many plugins for better responsive control, and this one feels the closest to what I would expect. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/blockstyleswp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Follow them on Twitter</a> as they share how they’re evolving these tools.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-18 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h1 id=\"h-cool-tools-for-ghouls\">Cool Tools for Ghouls</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Each week we feature one cool tool that can help make your life easier as a WordPress builder.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-just-add-some-balsamiq-with-an-eye-of-newt\">Just Add Some Balsamiq with an Eye of Newt</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://balsamiq.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Balsamiq</a> does one thing and does it well — it’s an application for creating wireframes.

Every time I end up coming back to Balsamiq because it’s so easy to get the vision out of my head and onto the screen. I know it’s been around a long time and its roots actually came from a <strong>Flash</strong>-built web app, but it has evolved to be a no-bloat application that lets you get in, do what you need, and get out.</p>\n</div></div>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 15:56:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Daniel Schutzsmith\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"Do The Woo Community: Building Your Community Without the Noise\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=73251\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://dothewoo.io/building-your-community-without-the-noise/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:401:\"<p>Active engagement and conversation can turn into unproductive noise.

That question may be key to keeping that mass market appeal from draining away to simpler, leaner SaaS alternatives. In an article <strong>Eric Karkovack</strong> shared this week in <strong><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/#choose-membership\">Post Status Slack</a></strong>, Eric has <a href=\"https://speckyboy.com/can-wordpress-appeal-to-diy-markets/\">some ideas for improving the WordPress user experience</a>, especially for DIY users setting up a website for the first time. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>We all have lists of plugins we disrecommend — to the point that it\'s a dealbreaker if a client insists on using them. And of course, these lists change a lot over time. We all know these things — but it\'s a kind of &#8220;open secret&#8221; within professional WordPress circles. That\'s understandable! Comparison is the thief of joy — and possibly revenue. But it\'s also not a healthy or sustainable situation.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the things Eric wants to see happen, like a standard interface for plugins and a curated view of the plugin ecosystem, are similar to views commonly expressed by designers, developers, and people in other professional roles at WordPress agencies serving enterprise clients. And why not? In the WordPress enterprise space, are the end users really that much different than mass-market WordPress users in what they do and <em>don\'t </em>need to quickly perform routine content creation and management tasks? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s where my thinking has been lately, so I had a conversation with Eric to see if we might identify areas where nearly everyone thinks WordPress offers a poor experience and how we might align ourselves toward solutions. Can we get everyone to &#8220;yes&#8221; on a better UX?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Don\'t Play Favorites — Recognize Excellence</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Standardizing admin interfaces and notifications might be easier than figuring out how to curate best-of-breed themes and plugins. But imagine, as Eric and I do in this conversation, some kind of &#8220;plugin quality score&#8221; at wordpress.org based on neutral, objective data. It might be &#8220;gamed&#8221; — in a positive way. It would encourage developers to do better, deeper, ever-maturing work. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally, I\'d like to see the maximum and the average number of queries a plugin adds to a page. That, along with PHP and WordPress versions that have been tested for compatibility (which are existing features of the plugin repository) would be key code quality indicators. Frequency of updates, reviews, and support responses would indicate a capacity for long-term sustainability.  Raising <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/we-dont-need-no-stinkin-standards/\">standards for testing aimed mainly at performance and security</a> would be great too. All of this could be done or encouraged by key players in the WordPress ecosystem coming together to set standards for their industry. It would impact how all users of the plugin directory understand quality and how best to assemble a WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Too Many Open Secrets About Quality are Bad for Everyone</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As of today, there are 60,153 uncurated free plugins at wordpress.org that can only be explored via external search and a limited (<a href=\"https://poststatus.com/a-visit-from-the-good-idea-fairy/\">arguably broken</a>) site search tool. WordPress professionals with high-end client services would never expose their customers to this chaos — so why does the WordPress community expose its newcomers to it? Anyone who has developed WordPress sites for very long has a list of plugins they prefer, particularly in combination with each other, for common feature sets and use cases. We all have lists of plugins we disrecommend — to the point that it\'s a dealbreaker if a client insists on using them. And of course, these lists change a lot over time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all know these things — but it\'s a kind of &#8220;open secret&#8221; within professional WordPress circles. That\'s understandable! Comparison is the thief of joy — and possibly revenue. But it\'s also not a healthy or sustainable situation. We need to be more open and better at communicating these things in a problem-solving, always-learning way within appropriate channels. <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/open-secrets-forced-updates-in-wordpress/\">Security is a slightly different issue</a>, but <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards\">performance and code quality standards</a> — and the products/people who follow them in exemplary ways — should be much more visible, celebrated, and learned from. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Information that maturing developers and product owners can learn from to improve their work doesn\'t trickle down as openly or as easily as it should. It\'s inside baseball, and it shouldn\'t be quite so insider-y. It\'s not out there alongside independent <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/kevin-ohashi-deep-history-and-integrity-in-hosting-benchmarks/\">plugin performance reviews</a> or clear standards and guidance for anyone who wants them. What if someone did a tutorial series walking through current WordPress code standards and the <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-coding-standards-has-reached-a/\">history</a> of <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/accessibility-draft-standards-are-ready-for-review/\">their</a> <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-coding-standards-1-2-1-has-been/\">evolution</a>? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why not? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are the barriers?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who can remove them?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Industry peers and WordPress community members working together on common interests?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Eric and I end up saying in our conversation, <em>we hope so!</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-24 wp-block-columns has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\" id=\"GoDaddy-Pro\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-22 wp-block-column\">\n<h3 id=\"GoDaddy-Pro\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f64f.png\" alt=\"🙏\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Sponsor: <a href=\"https://poststat.us/godaddypro\">GoDaddy Pro</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Manage your clients, websites, and tasks from a single dashboard with <strong>GoDaddy Pro</strong>.

For one, you know, we have full site editing that\'s been around for a little bit now, and, you know, we\'re not seeing like huge adoption rates with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\'re getting people to, um, you know, kind of learn what\'s involved with that and block themes and, um, [00:02:00] and also at the same time we\'re, you know, the, the changes that we\'ve seen, The block editor over time and you know, even the, kind of, the genesis of that project I think was to kind of compete with, um, more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Content management systems, kind of like, you know, WS or Squarespace and what have you. Um, and it seems like WordPress is just going toward that market more and more as they, as they build on. And so I thought those were really nice steps in that direction, right? So we have tools that. Make it a little bit easier for someone who maybe isn\'t, uh, familiar with code to go in and and build a, a site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that led me to think about, well, what else should we be doing in that area? What else could WordPress do to make it. Uh, as foolproof as possible, um, to build a basic site, not something necessarily like, um, you know, a complex, you know, high end enterprise site, [00:03:00] but just something basic that someone can do within a couple of hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that really kind of where that, the post came from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. Have you seen the, uh, videos where Jamie Marsland and, uh, who else did this had, had their daughters or, Um, I think of very different ages too, but it tried to do exactly that. And, um, he had, he had his kids do, um, um, Elementor versus Gutenberg, I think it was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Yeah. And that was, that was interesting. I mean, you really have to. That totally someone totally different from you, um, using it for the first time and Yeah, I think, I think a lot of, um, thought has gone into that user experience is, is huge. Uh, now, of course, always, always should have been, but um, Gutenberg is, is very squarely focused on the, on the user experience, building out your, your site and, and [00:04:00] pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, my, my thought though was everyone wants that. Um, it\'s not just the mass market, the lower and middle end, um, of that, but, um, agencies to up. The, uh, those that are serving enterprise, enterprise clients, uh, WordPress, v i p partners, um, I hear, I hear the same things from them, like, you know, even very recent conversations, um, about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How having standard interface that doesn\'t throw you different, totally different screens when you use, uh, a plugin in the back end. Um, that\'s a, a con basic design principle of there\'s much less cognitive load on you when the navigation is standard. Even if you\'ve never used WordPress before, um, [00:05:00] you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\'re f it seems familiar because things are intuitively laid out. Cause it\'s, it\'s like a lot of other things. WordPress is, is old enough and in so influential that it\'s, it\'s, uh, backend interface has been copied in a lot of ways. It\'s very, very familiar. Um, interestingly, even if people haven\'t used it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so when you hit a plugin with, you know, crazy level of setting screens or its own interface design, um, that\'s not, that doesn\'t. Look good with, uh, with anyone really, but with a enterprise client. I, I think that\'s an issue. That\'s one of the things you talk about in here. Um, Yeah, we have you thought about that at all?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, how, Yeah. Pretty much every market, every WordPress market, uh, could benefit from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> It\'s, it\'s funny you mentioned that cuz I really wasn\'t thinking of like the enterprise clients. And I [00:06:00] think the reason for that is because usually if I have a client who\'s a little more higher end on the, on the price scale, I\'m usually building things to kind of account for all of that right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where I can, I mean, obviously I can\'t change a in ui, but I can certainly do things with custom fields or blocks or what have you to try and make the, the content creation and editing process. Simple as possible for them. So by, by doing some of these things at core level, you would take away the need to build all that extra stuff on top to, you know, to make it easier for the corporate client to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it, it, it goes together pretty well. Um, The one example in terms of UI that I have in the article is, uh, you know, just looking at the standard WordPress settings page. We have the reading settings, and then next to it I have, uh, the opening screen of slider Revolution, which is, uh, plugin bundled with [00:07:00] a bunch of different schemes and, uh, like a theme forest, what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, it\'s like a completely different thing. And to, to that end, even Elementor is as well, I mean the, a lot of. Popular page builder plugins basically take over, uh, the UI and it\'s like you\'re in a completely different planet. And think about if you\'re a brand new user and you\'ve got just Elementor or Slider Revolution on your site, you bought this theme and it comes with these things, you\'re kind of thinking you\'re dropped into a middle of Mars or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\'re not sure what, you know how to get back to where you were and what the difference is between. You know, that UI based versus, you know, the, the core WordPress ui. Uh, in a lot of ways that doesn\'t make sense. So I think that\'s something we have to try and unify. Um, I don\'t know how we go about doing that at the core level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but I, I think if we make core as clean as possible, maybe that\'s at [00:08:00] least a good start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, there were, there would have to be, um, some, some standards in reusable. Patterns and, and tools. Um, I, I think that in the long run, the, uh, Gutenberg is, is supposed to eat the entire, you know, it\'s, it\'s a true ship of Tesus project where the entire thing gets rebuilt while moving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, And in, in some way it will be a, the goal is, is to have a unified experience at the end of that, just how quickly that happens depends on, on core contribution. Um, on the velocity of that, um, Yeah, that\'s for lack of that. I, I think it\'s, um, it\'s a bad experience for everyone and Sure. Uh, uh, an enterprise client is really just at bottom end users, uh, employees who have as much experience maybe as the average DIY site builder, a [00:09:00] creator, someone who wants to start a podcast or, or sell a product, um, as a side project or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s, there\'s really no difference there. Everyone, um, has the same, uh, usability needs in general, and more or less, there\'s, there\'s big differences when you, you started talking about compliance needs with accessibility and, and so on and, and things like that. But, um, yeah, it seems like to me that there, there\'s a lot of opportunity for aligning, um, different parts of, of the word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Community and business community where. Plug in. Developers and owners should really want this. The same thing that, uh, agency people, um, do. And that\'s, they, they support each other. Um, they feed each other business. So I, I\'m curious why. That hasn\'t [00:10:00] happened, and it seems to me like there\'s some information flows or I don\'t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There there are probably other, other sticky barriers. Have you, did you, did that question come up for you at all? Why? Um, why?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> Well, I know it\'s like, it\'s something we\'ve talked about a little bit, right? I mean, yeah, just on, on a few different levels and with the, uh, you know, Active install data going away from wordpress.org, and maybe these folks need to band together a little more and, and share amongst each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, I think the reason it hasn\'t happened yet is because it really hasn\'t had to, um, you know, maybe they haven\'t seen necessarily the benefit of it, but when you see kind of the, the yeah. Jumble of the, the UI right now and how it, how different it can be depending on what you have installed. You know, maybe there is something that, you know, some of these larger plugin developers could work together on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure. Uh, it makes sense. You know, it makes sense for all of them. I mean, [00:11:00] I, I, I somehow see us heading towards some sort of consortium of, of, uh, folks who, who can\'t necessarily write strict standards, but maybe they have certain. You know, broad outlines of, of what they, they want to, to abide by. And, you know, the more people that do that, the better I think it is for WordPress users and for just really everyone involved, because the software\'s going to be easier to use and more uniform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. There\'s, there\'s a lot that the, um, that, that part of the community could do for itself. I\'ve, uh, Tried to be more vocal about, but I, I think there, there have been a few, few voices behind those ideas of you, Hey, you, there\'s a lot you can do, um, to shape your own industry. Um, Yeah, if you do have a shared, a shared interface framework and, um, formal or informal standards for [00:12:00] Yeah, we were talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admin notifications previously. Um, that\'s part of it. Um, it, it\'d save you a lot of time if there was a base to build on. Um, more than, more than I think exists now. Um, so that, uh, anyone starting, starting out creating a, a new plugin, um, would have some kind of, uh, head start. Really a standard interface or, or guidance at least.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\'t know that there\'s that much, um, public information. And, uh, it\'s curious to me as, as, uh, as things like the W Commerce, um, partnership program kind of is a bit, looks like, a bit like a, getting into, uh, a relationship with WordPress, v i p. Um, there\'s criteria to go through, uh, that you have, well you have to meet, um, to become, um, a preferred agency working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, with w commerce.com side with [00:13:00] automatic, um, what those criteria are and what the standards are, should I think, have some kind of trickle down effect, like know what they are and, um, and have them as at least aspirational for everyone. Um, there\'s been some talk in, in, uh, core of, um, bringing. Some changes on, uh, on standards and testing for, uh, coding, um, coding standards for security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, I think primarily performance and security. Um, and I hope those continue to get prioritized that that\'s what all seems, seems to need to happen to, um, to move this forward. But the one point you mentioned, um, where you\'re talking about modernizing the onboarding experience, Where you direct people to, where to find themes, where to find plugins that, uh, [00:14:00] that becomes challenging and touches, touches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This other recent issue we\'ve talked about, um, it is hard to search in the, in the plugin repository is not in an ideal state and people who are trying to sell. Their plugins there, um, have a number of frustrations with, with trying to surface their, their products as relevant to what people are searching for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, do you think this could be part of a solution to that if, or a potential conflict point when you\'re curating, you\'re, you\'re curating and recommending, um, certain ones?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> Well, I think as far as, as core goes, um, my idea is more. Just pointing people to the repositories. Mm-hmm. , uh, for themes and plugins, not necessarily being a, uh, a [00:15:00] curator, but, um, I, I, I see the, you know, I see there, there, there should be more impetus to improve the, the repositories and make them easier for folks to search and figure out what it is they\'re getting and what, you know, um, allow new entries to be a little more, uh, visible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think they\'re kind of separate things, you know, just to be able to, I mean, if, if you\'re installing WordPress now from the, you know, from, from your host, or if you\'re, you know, FTPing it up to your site, old school style, um, you know, you\'re, you\'re gonna get this little. Widget did on the, on the front screen of the dashboard that welcomes you to WordPress and gives you a few handy links, but it doesn\'t really tell you about how to actually use what you\'re, you\'ve got.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that was where I, I thought improvement could be made right now. I mean the person that doesn\'t understand where themes reside or where plug-ins reside, they\'re not [00:16:00] gonna know necessarily to go under the appearance menu and look to add a theme or you know, the plug-ins menu. You know, they may find that eventually, but why not put it right out there in front of \'em so that they can easily click and say, Okay, I know what I need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I need to get a plugin that does this. And you know, cuz we have a nice interface to actually go in and. Poor plugins and themes, but Right. It\'s not necessarily, um, in front of, front of your mind when you, when you first install WordPress. So I thought that was, um, something that was important to, uh, you know, to, to emphasize in this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Sure. Yeah. And that, that seems like it, it\'s potentially in a good way, open for change with, uh, potential changes to the.org repository. And, and I imagine that as, um, as the.com marketplace. Um, and, you know, potentially other, other things like that. Um, If, if other hosts hosting W Commerce or, or [00:17:00] WordPress were to do something similar, um, that, that, that requires some kind of curation at some point or some, some way of featuring particular things like, this is what you need to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, for, for example, you know, one of my pet things is can you build a, uh, sub stack like, uh, site out of WordPress very quickly. Yes, if you know how. But, um, the, there\'s act, those documentations kind of emerged relatively recently for doing that with a, a couple of plugins. Um, if you dig around on wordpress.com, um, and I, like Kim Coleman is, uh, for, uh, uh, paid memberships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pro is giving a talk right about now, I think on. On how to do that with, uh, Mail poet and their product, the Coleman\'s product, uh, paid membership pro. Um, that\'s, that\'s something that, um, yeah, [00:18:00] I, I agree. It\'s, it\'s tri on the, on the mass market level. It\'s, it\'s sort of the level of suggestion of here\'s if you want to do this, here are some ways you can do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And. What gets recommended there, I, I guess, is, is maybe a, a thorny issue, but as you kind of move up the up the market, um, you don\'t want give that much. You don\'t want to have an onboarding screen that says install this and this and this to, uh, you know, an agency\'s client. Uh, you know, you don\'t, they don\'t wanna see that either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, um, you want to actually be making those choices. For them. So it occurs to me that the thing that\'s not talked about OP openly but is talked about everywhere is that the upmarket WordPress and building even, you know, freelancers, small agencies to v i P agencies generally, um, you know, have their own ways of doing things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:00] That do a lot of curation and like you said, building, building custom materials. But the less you do that, the less you have to support yourself. Um, that they\'re essentially doing, making these choices and saying, these are the things that work well for these purposes under these conditions. And I\'ve always thought, why should that be a proprietary trade secret, especially when it\'s out there, but.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\'re hesitant to, uh, convey that or some version of that to the, um, to the mass market. Um, what, what do you, what do you think about that? Do you think there could be some synergies there? Cause there\'s learning potential too, if you, if you kind of disclose, this is how we\'re doing it up here. Um, people who are just starting out building with WordPress are learning from leaders then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> Yeah. Um, well, one of the things I. I, I talked about with curation was, you know, maybe managed hosts are in the best [00:20:00] position to do kind of something like that, because I think some of them already do to, to a degree. I mean, many of them are buying up, you know, plugin and themes anyway. And so, you know, maybe they\'re in the best position to add something like this, The WordPress, um, for someone that has the fresh install, You know, in the community it\'s, it\'s interesting because there\'s just so many, there\'s so many plugins and so many opinions that you know mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I may ask, well how do you build a membership site? And somebody may tell me, paid memberships, pros the way to go. Somebody may say, Member press, or, you know, there there could be five or six other, you know, really big players in that market. Um, same thing for forms and, you know, e-commerce may be a little bit less, but, um, you know, cuz we have one dominant, uh, you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Entity there in W Commerce. But, um, you know, if you ask about w commerce extensions, you\'ll probably get a couple hundred different answers on that, so. Right. You know, the curation is a, a [00:21:00] bit of a tough, a tough call. Like, I, I don\'t, I certainly don\'t think, you know, the WordPress project should be, um, doing anything other than generically taking you to the, you know, Repositories and saying, this is where you can find plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, maybe in the future they write, you know, they, they share articles or something about, well, you know, if you\'re going to build an e-commerce site, maybe you should consider X, Y, and Z. Not necessarily talking about. Specific plugins, but things you need to consider on your end and find to help you find the, the tool that works best for your needs and, you know, design for what your workflow is going to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so maybe if we can add some guidance in that way without necessarily favoring one product over another. Um, but I, I, I think they\'re, you know, for the new user, the person who wants to just build their own basic site, Having some sort of guidance in [00:22:00] not only what plugins to use, but just how to use WordPress, I think could be, you know, extremely helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yes. Uh, yeah, I, I agree with you. Um, you know, the way you, you put it here was, um, Uh, yeah, the, who would be responsible for curating is the, is the really tough issue. You\'d need a, a third party of some, some kind to take that on. Um, and yeah, in the mass market where everyone\'s competing, um, with, with their product or service, um, that\'s a difficult one to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who, who would be a third party? Who could, who could potentially navigate those, those waters? And are, are there things that the plugin repo could do that are sufficiently neutral with the kind of data that, that could be reported out that would, um, help that? Um, do we need something like Kevin Ohashi doing, um, you know, [00:23:00] plugin performance?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP plugin performance reviews, like his hosting, uh, reviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> Yeah, that, that\'s interesting. You could, you, you could certainly see the repo. I mean, you know, again, you don\'t wanna play favorites. That\'s definitely, you know, gonna cause a lot of problems. Um, maybe there could be, you know, stats for, you know, different types of sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, if you are into publishing, these are the most popular plugins in that category. Because we don\'t, It may even be listed that way now, but we don\'t necessarily say that. Um, so you could look at, you know, membership sites, you could look at e-commerce, um, you know, selling digital goods, all those types of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe we break it down by category a little more and just show what the trends are in that area. It doesn\'t necessarily have to favor anyone, but obviously it\'s going to show, you know, who\'s in the lead and who\'s not. Maybe that\'s [00:24:00] something to help people again and again, I, I put these out there as ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They may be extremely flawed and, uh, you know, you can certainly tell me on Twitter if, if, if you don\'t agree. Uh, but just I think we need to find more ways to empower people to make good decisions with WordPress. Um, that\'s going to keep people on the platform. Throughout and they\'re going to hopefully have less frustration in trying to get started because I think that\'s, from my experience, that\'s the area where people are, you know, hit that wall after installing, They\'re like, Okay, well what do I do next?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. I wonder, I wonder if something like a, uh, plugin quality score could be developed. Which, which to some extent is being done with, with, uh, review, like combining, uh, correlating, um, support tickets and response to those and, [00:25:00] um, installs and, and things like that. But I wonder if you could, you could do a quality, um, rating that would be sufficiently neutral that people would accept.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The curation that developed from that. Say, I, I keep thinking of this one. I don\'t, I don\'t know if it\'s realistic, but, um, I would love to know on every plugin if I install this, what\'s the, what\'s the maximum number of queries it will add to a page load? What\'s the average number? And, um, that right there creates an incentive to plug in developers to get that right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn, you know, if you\'re just starting out, uh, coding something, um, learn what that means, why it matters. Um, because that\'s, that seems to be one of the real, real slow downs. Um, and, and that\'s a pretty objective measure. Fewer queries, quicker response, um, from the server, [00:26:00] something like that. I don\'t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you, do you think that that sort of thing could potentially be done, um, as. Sufficiently neutral thing coming from the, From</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> I think so. I think so. I mean, one idea that just kind of popped in my head was, how about we do something activity based? Hmm. Like, just for example, um, we take into account how often a plugin updates, uh, how responsive, uh, Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, support requests are in the forms. That doesn\'t necessarily tell you the quality. Now I. You might be updating your plugin three or four times a week because it\'s broken, and you may be re responding to, you know, support requests without necessarily resolving problems. But that might be a way to, to, to help steer people away from plugins that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haven\'t been updated in years. I mean, we have that little warning on there now that, you know, when it\'s been, I think, what three versions. It\'ll tell [00:27:00] you that, hey, this hasn\'t been, you know, updated in, in a while, huh? But if you had maybe some sort of activity based scoring that, you know, I mean, you know, that, that puts everybody, I think on a.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Closer playing field. I don\'t know if it\'s completely level, but you know, I mean, the plugins with the most resources might, you know, be able to, to, uh, to win on some of that. But then again, if you have a, a solo entrepreneur who\'s got a plugin that you know, they really are passionate about and they\'re constantly trying to improve and they\'re, you know, we know there are a lot of those out there, you know, they might be able to, to compete on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Sure. Yeah. I, I feel, I feel like that could work if the repository made some distinction between completely free plugins and freemium model plugins, or those that have, uh, a recognized business entity behind it with. Staff and [00:28:00] like this, We exist here to support this in theory, in in perpetuity. Um, because actually there, there are some plugin if you base this on activity like TenUp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, there\'s some, Jake Goldman still has under, under his account on, uh, on the repo that are really nice, simple, single purpose plugins and I completely trust. The support for them, for them, for the, for the most part. But, um, they\'re not, they\'re not gonna be high volume, um, uh, support activity there or updates, and they\'re pretty simple, yet reliable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, it might be tricky to do that, but I, I think it would be fair to recognize. Leaders and high performers and recognized experts at, at some point. And, um, and the business, um, you know, the number of people who, you know, who actually exist to support [00:29:00] a particular plugin. That was when I was, when I\'m doing things for clients and when I was doing that a lot more, um, you\'re looking at, I, I try to look at what\'s gonna be around for a long, long term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, the, the fewer, uh, We don\'t wanna make changes to themes, to major plugin changes. Um, over time we want this to be really stable. So, so to me a concern would be, Hey, this is a really nice plugin, seems really well supported, but there\'s no business model behind it. Or it\'s not one that, yeah, I think will be here in five, even just five years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and the long term view. Yeah. Is another, is another criteria that\'s hard to, hard to suss out. Um, but those are, those are all potentially valid ways to curate, um, and indicate different, different categories of, of product that may really help people figure out what they need. Um, yeah, it\'s a [00:30:00] good, good question, uh, to open.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> Yeah, I think there\'s, there\'s potential for it. Um, you know, any, I think anything we can do to make it, give people more confidence that what they\'re installing is going to work and be, you know, stable and, you know, allow them to do. What they want to do easy in a more easy fashion. I think that would, you know, definitely be a benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And just going back to the activity thing for just a second, I mean, how many plugins that are still, you know, somewhat maintained, Still say that their, their latest compatibility is like WordPress 5.8 or 5.9. Right. You know, just the simple fact of going in and, and testing with WordPress six or 6.1, maybe that gets you, you know, some brownie points in that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just that you version checked and you know, you\'re keeping up with that. Because I see that as another issue [00:31:00] in the repository where, There may be plugins that work perfectly well, but you\'re still a little hesitant because it, Yeah. You know, the compatibility hasn\'t been updated in two years or three years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that could also be, you know, a</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> factor. And it\'s not just compatibility to WordPress, it\'s, uh, you know, word WordPress, GUIs and, and compatibility for php. So plug in, plug in compatibility with, uh, which, what up to what version of PHP will it. Will it operate</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> and Yeah. Just checking. Yeah, I know. Uh, like I\'m looking at a, a plugin now it says PHP version 5.4 or higher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there you go. Ah, right, right, right. You\'re in good shape, even out in a really, really old install.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yes. Right. So that raises some, some ideas. Well, that\'s, and that\'s something a DIY person isn\'t gonna know. They aren\'t, they aren\'t going to know. Um, you know, what version of PHP is my. Running and what does that mean and, and all that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:00] Yeah. Support activity and development activity are, are good indicators, but then you, you can game that as well. Um, well, it creates, it creates a good incentive to do that work. But then, you know, are we adding features or minor updates just to, uh, to rank higher at that point. I don\'t know if it would have that, that kind of effect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> I mean, we\'ve seen it with reviews, right? Yeah. People put in the phony reviews and or higher out firms to, to do that for them. So yeah, any, anything that they put in probably could be gained. I don\'t know if we\'re gonna fully prevent that, but you hope that, you know, most developers take it as a, uh, a serious matter and, you know, try to actually put in the hard work to, to rank highly and, and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully that that\'s a way for them to kind of go up the charts a little bit in, in terms of how many installs they have and how many paying customers they get because of it. Right. [00:33:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. And there\'s, there\'s such a categorical difference between people who are running their business that way. And well, it\'s a good, it\'s a good way to game things towards more support, more development, and, uh, taking an active interest in, in what\'s going on with your, your product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in the way it\'s, uh, presented to people who are going to install it. Um, and it\'s. Good idea. I, I do feel that those things go together. Any, anything that improves or changes in, in core to change the onboarding experience to, um, make it easier with respect to what you install, has gotta be corresponding somehow to, um, what you see on the on.org, um, what it\'s putting out publicly as a, as a signal for, um, for quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last thing. Well close to where you, you closed was, was talking about outreach, um, that we should just show what, what WordPress can do. [00:34:00] Um, and do you think we just don\'t do that enough or it\'s not unified enough? Or just in the Gutenberg era, we\'re just beginning to see tutorials and guides, um, show up, especially for non-technical users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, that\'s, that\'s something. on.org, Learn, Learn. Um, wordpress.org is, uh, busy trying to do, there\'s a ton of meetups coming out that are really geared towards this sort of thing. Um, and, and also people who are building at sites at a more advanced level. Um, do you see that as something that\'s just starting to happen or something altogether different that you had in mind?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> I, I sort of see this as kind of like a, a. Coming of WordPress, right? Because when a lot of us, you know, who have been in this a while started, you know, if you went to a Word camp, you probably learned an awful lot about the basics of WordPress. Whether you were just [00:35:00] using it as, you know, a content creator, or you were a developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think we\'ve kind of lost that along the way a little bit. We\'ve kind of focused so much on the more advanced topics. And then of course, the pandemic, you know, took away a, a lot of the in person events. So I, I think, you know, the word camps are one way to really start showing, you know, new users what\'s possible and you know, how to, to do the basics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you know, I, I would, I honestly, I would love to see that at Word Camp us or one of the really. International events, you know, have a track just for new people, uh, you know, where they can ask experts questions, you know, that people that, you know, we, we see in the post status slack or we see on online all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, if, if a new user\'s able to ask them questions that, you know, that can go a long way towards selling them on the platform and keeping them there. Um, and you mentioned the learn [00:36:00] tool. Well, I, I think that\'s fantastic. That\'s actually something I brought up on the, uh, on the slack the other day. You know, Has there been any effort to kind of integrate that with the core software so that you can easily find tutorials?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, maybe through a plugin or, or something like that? Because we have various WordPress support, uh, tools that are third party, you know, that\'ll show videos on how to do different things. We have this wonderful resource and if somebody doesn\'t visit wordpress.org, they\'re really not gonna know it\'s. And I think, you know, it\'s such an opportunity to reach people and, and teach them how to do anything from the basics to, you know, once they level up to, you know, some more advanced things, it\'s all right there waiting and, you know, all we have to do in some way, some respects is, you know, put it in front of them, You know, give them the opportunity to see it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so those are things, you know. The WordPress community has so much great content, so many smart people. I think we [00:37:00] ought to be able to put our heads together and, and find ways to, you know, encourage new users and embrace them and, and, and, you know, kind of help them, you know, with any stumbling blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because, you know, if once we kind of. Hate to say the phrase die out. You know, what, what, what is the next generation of WordPress user going to look like? How, how are they going to use the software? You know, if we want to keep it as a market leader, we want to keep it, uh, viable, you know, the new users are, you know, just critical</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> to that, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I, I think that Learn is, uh, learn. WordPress is. Logical, the content that\'s being developed there and also the meetups that are going on, the, um, kind of webinars that are, that are happening are, um, are logical to move into the dashboard for certain, um, certain use [00:38:00] cases, um, in the, in mass market, DIY users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, well, It\'s been good talking to you again. I, I think this, this is a good, a good topic with a lot of questions in it that touch a couple of the main, main conversations and, and issues today that we\'ve, we\'ve been all, all thinking about, um, what to do with, uh, potential changes to the plugin repository and, and the kind of data that that comes out of there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dot org content and information can somehow fit into the, um, into the WordPress dashboard and, um, interface there to help people and connect them with the community. Um, how we could maybe standardize, uh, the experience and some interface design, how things are, are done on the back end that, um, makes [00:39:00] it a more palatable and, uh, Less busy interruptive, um, or confused experience on, on sites with a lot of things installed, whether it\'s, um, someone just setting up their own, their own site, or, uh, an agency doing it for a, a high end client.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I think the more, the more we see those all as, uh, common problems everyone has. The better chance at br at bringing everyone towards a, an aligned solution where everyone wins. Um, ideally one, one would hope .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> There\'s potential there. Absolutely. Hope so. Um, you know, The, the, you know, if you start the conversation, hopefully, um, you know, you bring in some good ideas and if we see a few of them implemented, uh, that\'s like you said, that\'s gonna benefit everybody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> You have been listening to post status excerpt, a podcast from post Status, the [00:40:00] community for WordPress professionals.

The WordPress-specific chapter was published earlier this month with metrics that indicate <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/2022-web-almanac-report-finds-wordpress-adoption-is-growing-adds-new-page-builder-data\">adoption is growing</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Performance chapter was written by Etsy performance engineer Melissa Ada and Google web transparency engineer Rick Viscomi. Performance metrics in the chapter focus on <a href=\"https://web.dev/vitals/\">Core Web Vitals</a> (CWV), which Google introduced in 2020 and <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/11/timing-for-page-experience\">made a ranking signal</a> in 2021. They used the public <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux/\">Chrome UX Report</a> (CrUX) dataset for the report, which collects data from <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux/methodology/#eligibility\">eligible websites</a> &#8211; publicly discoverable sites with an undisclosed minimum number of visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the data concerns the performance of the web as a whole over time, but the 2022 Web Almanac highlighted one specific concern regarding WordPress sites&#8217; use of lazy-loading and its impact on LCP performance. Google defines <a href=\"https://web.dev/lcp/\">Largest Contentful Paint metric (LCP)</a> metrics as “the render time of the largest <a href=\"https://web.dev/lcp/#what-elements-are-considered\">image or text block</a> visible within the viewport, relative to when the page <a href=\"https://w3c.github.io/hr-time/#timeorigin-attribute\">first started loading</a>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Lazy-loading is a good thing when used correctly, but these stats strongly suggest that there’s a major opportunity to improve performance by removing this functionality from LCP images in particular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress was one of the pioneers of native lazy-loading adoption, and between versions 5.5 and 5.9, it didn’t actually omit the attribute from LCP candidates. So let’s explore the extent to which WordPress is still contributing to this anti-pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/cms\">CMS</a> chapter, <a href=\"https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/cms#most-popular-cmss\">WordPress is used by 35% of pages</a>. So it’s surprising to see that 72% of pages that use native lazy-loading on their LCP image are using WordPress, given that a fix has been available since January 2022 in version 5.9. One theory that needs more investigation is that plugins may be circumventing the safeguards built into WordPress core by injecting LCP images onto the page with the lazy-loading behavior.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, a disproportionately high percentage of pages that use custom lazy-loading are built with WordPress at 54%. This hints at a wider issue in the WordPress ecosystem about lazy-loading overuse. Rather than being a fixable bug localized to WordPress core, there may be hundreds or thousands of separate themes and plugins contributing to this anti-pattern.</p>\n<cite><a href=\"https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/performance\">2022 Web Almanac &#8211; Chapter 12: Performance</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to WordPress 5.9, WordPress’ default of lazy loading implementation was causing slower LCP performance, because it had been applied too aggressively and was lazy-loading images above the fold. In 5.9, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-9-to-fix-lazy-loading-performance-regression-resulting-in-30-faster-page-loads-in-some-cases\">WordPress shipped a fix</a> that more eagerly loads images within the initial viewport while lazy-loading the rest. That&#8217;s why results that show WordPress sites overusing lazy-loading are surprising.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Admittedly, &#8216;lazy-overloading&#8217; a hard problem to solve,&#8221; Viscomi said in his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rick_viscomi/status/1585248419701874688\">Twitter thread analysis</a>. &#8220;We don&#8217;t always know whether an image will be the LCP.  WordPress core sets it on every image by default and uses heuristics to unset it. Nearly 3/4 of pages that natively lazy-load images are on WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, Viscomi remarked on how quickly the adoption of native image lazy-loading shot up after WordPress 5.5 was released in August of that year with  images lazy-loaded by default. WordPress has been driving adoption of this feature, which is why any implementation &#8220;anti-pattern,&#8221; as Viscomi characterized it, has an outsized effect on the performance of the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">As of October, 10.6% of the web is using native image lazy loading, per <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HTTPArchive?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@HTTPArchive</a>. That number was 1.5% in July! <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f92f.png\" alt=\"🤯\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><br /><br />This appears to be _entirely_ driven by WordPress at 28.9% of WP pages, which makes up one third of the web.<a href=\"https://t.co/QYGyyctFgc\">https://t.co/QYGyyctFgc</a><br /><br />left: all web<br />right: WP <a href=\"https://t.co/RQnDw4UZ56\">pic.twitter.com/RQnDw4UZ56</a></p>&mdash; Rick Viscomi (@rick_viscomi) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rick_viscomi/status/1344380340153016321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 30, 2020</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What gives, WordPress?&#8221; Viscomi said. &#8220;My theory is that it&#8217;s not the core heuristics that are wrong, it&#8217;s the plugins. Also, keep in mind that the majority of pages that even use lazy-loading are WP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;To support the plugin theory, let&#8217;s look at custom lazy-loading of LCP: More than half of the pages that do it are built with WordPress. WordPress is &#8216;only&#8217; a third of the web, so there&#8217;s clearly something going on with JS-based lazy-overloading in WP.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On WordPress.org there are <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/lazy+loading/\">multiple pages</a> of performance, caching, and image and video optimization plugins that are using lazy-loading in some way. Plugin and theme developers who are using lazy-loading in their extensions may want to test their implementations to see if they are having a negative impact on LCP performance.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 03:04:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:106:\"WPTavern: #48 – Christina Deemer on Making Digital Content Usable for People With Cognitive Disabilities\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://wptavern.com/?post_type=podcast&p=138814\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:120:\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/48-christina-deemer-on-making-digital-content-usable-for-people-with-cognitive-disabilities\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42987:\"Transcript<div>\n<p>Christina Deemer</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Welcome to the Jukebox podcast from WP Tavern.

Christina is a senior UX developer at Lede, a company of the Alley Group, where she champions accessibility and headless WordPress in her work with publishers and nonprofits. She&#8217;s passionate about inclusivity and community and has spoken at a variety of events about the subject.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christina is autistic and brings her personal experience with neurodivergence and disability to bear in her work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the recent WordCamp US, Christina gave a presentation called &#8220;embracing minds of all kinds, making digital content usable for people with cognitive disabilities&#8221;. And it&#8217;s this talk, which is the foundation of the podcast today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In her description of the presentation, Christina wrote, &#8220;cognitive disabilities are among the most prevalent types of disabilities, yet experts have struggled to provide web accessibility best practices around this area due to cognitive disabilities being such a broad category. However recent work by standards groups has begun to address this deficiency&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In past episodes, we&#8217;ve covered website accessibility from some different angles, and today we focus on how the web might be experienced by people with cognitive disabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, Christina talks about what the term cognitive disabilities actually means, and what it encompasses. It&#8217;s a wide range of things, and so we talk about how people may differ in the way that they access the web. Memory, over complicated interfaces and readability are a few of the areas that we touch upon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also discuss what legislation there is in place to offer guidance to those wishing to make their sites more accessible, and as you&#8217;ll hear, it&#8217;s a changing landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end, Christina talks about her own late diagnosis of autism and how this shapes her experience of the web, particularly with auto-play content and when web design includes elements which flash or flicker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically when we record the podcast there&#8217;s not a lot of background noise, but that&#8217;s not always the case. This is the last of the live recordings from WordCamp US 2022, and you may notice that the recordings have a little echo or other strange audio artifacts. Whilst the podcasts are more than listenable, I do hope that you understand that the vagaries of the real world were at play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links and the show notes by heading over to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all of the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, without further I bring you Christina Deemer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Christina Deemer. Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:14] <strong>Christina Deemer:</strong> Hello Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s very nice to have you on. We are at WordCamp US 2022. We&#8217;re upstairs in the media room, and we&#8217;ve got Christina on the show today because she did a presentation. Have you actually done the presentation yet?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:27] <strong>Christina Deemer:</strong> Yes, I did it yesterday morning. I was lucky in that I got to get it over with early and then enjoy the rest of the conference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How did it go?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:35] <strong>Christina Deemer:</strong> It went really well. It was a lot of fun. I had a really great audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s nice to hear. That&#8217;s good. The subject, I&#8217;m just gonna give everybody the title. That&#8217;s probably a quick way to introduce what we&#8217;re gonna talk about. The subject title was embracing minds of all kinds, making digital content usable for people with cognitive disabilities. So we&#8217;ll dive into that in a moment. Just before then, though, just paint a little bit of a picture about who you are and how come it is that you&#8217;re speaking at a WordPress conference particularly about this topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:04] <strong>Christina Deemer:</strong> Okay. I am a career changer. I spent the first 12 years or so of my career working in arts management. Then I decided I wanted to do something very different, and I became a developer. And one of my early mentors introduced me to WordPress. So, the first projects that I worked on were WordPress sites. I wrote my first WordPress theme when I was 35, and just really enjoyed getting involved in the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And from the beginning of my career, I&#8217;ve been very interested in accessibility for a wide variety of reasons. And it&#8217;s become a passion of mine. I really enjoy sharing knowledge about accessibility with people. I enjoy hearing people&#8217;s stories about accessibility. And recently there&#8217;s been a lot of work done on the standards around cognitive accessibility or accessibility for people with cognitive disabilities, and that work has been really fascinating and I&#8217;ve wanted to share it with people. And that was how, the reason that I pitched this talk for WordCamp US.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you. That&#8217;s great. The words cognitive disabilities, it probably makes a great deal of sense to you because you&#8217;ve parsed and you&#8217;ve said it many times. You fully understand it. Would you just run over a brief definition of what it encompasses? And I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s not just one thing, maybe it&#8217;s a multitude of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:28] <strong>Christina Deemer:</strong> So it&#8217;s a very nebulous term, and it acts as a sort of umbrella for neurological disorders as well as behavioral and mental health disorders that may or may not be neurological. It covers a wide variety of things from autism, ADHD, aphasia, dementia, dyslexia, dyscalculia, tourette syndrome, traumatic brain injury.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It covers a real wide variety of things, which is one of the reasons actually why it&#8217;s taken so long to develop some standards around how to make websites more accessible to people with those diagnoses. But just to take a little further step back with things. When I talk about this I really try to make a point to not focus on some of these sort of diagnostic labels, but to rather focus on underlying cognitive skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because a lot of people with cognitive disabilities don&#8217;t even realize they have a disability, for a number of reasons. There are a lot of systemic barriers to getting a diagnosis, and a lot of things come into play there. But really what we&#8217;re talking about is some underlying cognitive skills, like memory issues, focus issues, ability to concentrate, reading, math and language comprehension, decision making, executive function, which has to do with the processes involved in following instructions and planning things and processing a bunch of things at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, when I talk about cognitive accessibility, I really like to focus less on those diagnostic labels and more on the underlying cognitive skills that are involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So from that, I take it that cognitive disabilities, as you described it, was a long list. There was a really large amount of things that you&#8217;re covering here, which is really interesting. So let&#8217;s unpack that a little bit. Just before we clicked record, I mentioned that we may get into the weeds of what it is like for people who have some of these things. And maybe we could cherry pick some examples.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I&#8217;m intending to do here is for you to paint a picture of what the web looks like for some of these different things. So in my case, when I approach the computer and open it up and get it started, I can see the screen, I can hear the video when it&#8217;s played. I just don&#8217;t really have a window into what that might look like. So if you have a moment to just broadly paint a picture of what some of these things feel like and look like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:01] <strong>Christina Deemer:</strong> Sure, and even people who are somewhat familiar with general accessibility and maybe more accustomed to thinking about what the web is like for people who use screen readers. So they think about, they&#8217;ve maybe done some testing and they know how things are read. They think about reading order, and how a screen reader works. And when they&#8217;re thinking about making sites accessible for people who are deaf, they are thinking about making sure that there are captions on videos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when we&#8217;re thinking about cognitive accessibility, we&#8217;re thinking about some other issues. So in my talk yesterday, I had a couple of examples of sites that are pages that had weak cognitive accessibility. And one of them was a desktop screen of an interface of eBay, like buying a shirt on eBay. And in the middle of the page, there were four calls to action, with three different designs. So it wasn&#8217;t clear what the user was supposed to push. There was no clear call to action. There was very little white space on the page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this isn&#8217;t great for users with cognitive disability. Somebody who has an issue with focus is not going to know really where to look on the page. Could get distracted by all of the various details. All of the sidebars on the left, little small text below an image. People who struggle with decision making haven&#8217;t helped them with those four CTAs in the middle of the page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anybody with memory issues, it&#8217;s not going to be clear, like, if they bought something on eBay previously. They won&#8217;t remember what they did last time because it&#8217;s a little confusing. So a lot of users may abandon their task on a page like that. So that&#8217;s an example of a page that maybe has complex or overwhelming interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And another barrier that users face is if a site has very complex text or unusual words. So I mention Wikipedia page on the planet Saturn, that included words like perihelion, and a word like eccentricity, but people may not be accustomed to understanding what Saturn&#8217;s eccentricity is. Like, what does that even mean?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, readability is often analyzed through a, a system called the Flesh Reading E Score. And I went to a website that measures the readability of, particularly of, Wikipedia pages. And it indicated that this page had a reading level of 10 to 12th grade. So it was very, very difficult to read. And for most adults we say that the reading level of content should be at about a seventh or eighth grade level. So if you want to make your content accessible for people who have reading or language comprehension issues, you&#8217;re going to want to go with even simpler content. A readability of about sixth grade or less. So those are of a couple of examples of some barriers that users with cognitive disabilities face on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the accessibility piece, the bit that you mentioned earlier, about potentially some of the WCAG guidelines and things like that. That now is being drawn into the domain of, it&#8217;s illegal if you don&#8217;t perform some of these things. Is there anything surrounding that with the cognitive disability side. Is there any mandated things that you must do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:17] <strong>Christina Deemer:</strong> Okay, so that&#8217;s where things are evolving, a lot and some really interesting things are happening. In WCAG 2.1, there&#8217;s already a couple of things, a couple of success criteria that address cognitive accessibility. Things around space around text, stuff like that. Auto filling in or making it possible to auto complete form fields. Those things are great for people with language or reading comprehension issues, people who have issues with focus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In April, 2021, the W3C came out with a working group note on guidelines for making content more usable for people with cognitive disabilities. And this was a non-normative document, which meant that it was supplementary to WCAG and you don&#8217;t need to conform, follow these guidelines in order to meet WCAG compliance. So they came out with all of these really great framework, with eight objectives, dozens of design patterns, and none of that is necessary to comply with WCAG. So, yeah, that was April 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now we&#8217;re in September 2022. We now have WCAG 2.2 is in candidate recommendation, I think. And there are two new success criteria that feel like they&#8217;ve come directly out of that working group note. One is on accessible authentication, which is where you need to supply at least one method for logging in that doesn&#8217;t rely on cognitive skills. So you need to have at least one option where somebody doesn&#8217;t have to, by memory, type in their password. They can use a password manager or there&#8217;s an option for magic links, QR codes, single sign on, something like that. So that&#8217;s a new one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s also a new success criteria on consistent help. Oftentimes the quickest way for somebody to solve a challenge online is to get help from a real person that can support users. And it&#8217;s important that this information on like how to get help from a real person isn&#8217;t hidden. You don&#8217;t have to scroll and click through a bunch of non obvious links to find out how to get help from a real person. That information is accessible in the same place on consistent pages. And that&#8217;s just even having an email address for help, or a number to get help via text, or social, or a chatbot or something that&#8217;s not a chat, that&#8217;s a real person or something. Just making it possible for somebody to get help from a real person</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;re seeing some of these things that were in that working group note come into the standard, which is very exciting. And part of the reason there were all of these design patterns in the working group note in the April, 2021 working group note, that are not included in the standard, in 2.2. And I think that&#8217;s for a variety of reasons. Like one of them is that so much of it is it&#8217;s hard to figure out a way to test it. To like design it so that you can have some sort of measurable test of yes, you are conforming with this or you aren&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of it, with cognitive disabilities is very contextual and subjective, and it depends on your product and it depends on so many different things that they haven&#8217;t figured out a way to create testable success criteria yet. But it&#8217;s exciting to me that we at . Least have these two new success criteria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Is one of the things that makes this difficult to pin down, is it because unlike, let&#8217;s take the example of somebody who is blind, it&#8217;s binary in that case. I don&#8217;t mean you, your heart of sight, I mean you are literally blind. You know what to do with that because the outcome is obvious. You can&#8217;t see the screen. So there&#8217;s remedies for that, and you can create those remedies with screen readers and so on. But it sounds like the description of cognitive disabilities, there&#8217;s such a broad spectrum. It&#8217;s hard to pin it down, so it&#8217;s hard to create the solution because each person may be slightly different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:15] <strong>Christina Deemer:</strong> Absolutely. And there&#8217;s a saying in the autism community that when you&#8217;ve met one autistic person, you&#8217;ve met one autistic person. So a lot of times with these things, you can have an interface that works for one person who has a lot of trouble with memory, may not work for another person. Or even that same person when they&#8217;re having a good day versus having a bad day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it is very hard to pin down. It comes down then not to an argument about we have to do this to legally comply with the standard, to not get into trouble. It comes down to, you have to do this or you should do this because you want to do the right thing for your users. And sometimes, I talk about this in my talk, that there can be sometimes tension between like business goals and accessibility goals or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there are a lot of ways to find the like win . Win. You know we&#8217;re improving things for users, for disabled users also improves things for your business goals. But you really have to get out of more of a checklist, we&#8217;re doing this because it&#8217;s legal, because we need to legally comply with the standard, to like having a more accessibility mindset about it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that makes sense. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re American, but we&#8217;re in America. I&#8217;m from the UK. So, completely different sides of the world really. And obviously you take in every other country on the planet, there&#8217;s gonna be a different complexion there. Is there broad consensus of how important it is across the world? Or is it very much a case that America&#8217;s doing one thing and the UK is doing another, and Australia and all the other countries that we could mention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:47] <strong>Christina Deemer:</strong> I can speak more about that in terms of accessibility in general. So there are different laws in different places, which sounds like a really obvious thing when I say it that way. But what&#8217;s really great about WCAG is that it is a sort of internationally recognized standard, and a lot of countries use WCAG as a standard, and they&#8217;ll refer to it because it is kept up to date, because it is all testable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are like slightly different laws in different places, but a lot of places do fall back to WCAG, usually the double A standard. Depends on the places and everything, but a lot of times a law may apply only to like government websites, or sites that serve the public interest or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think there&#8217;s still a lot of debate around whether or not websites fall under the Americans with Disability Act. There&#8217;s still some argument about that. I mentored a developer out of the UK on accessibility at the end of 2021, in the beginning of 2022, and we talked a little bit about some of the laws there and they&#8217;re, yeah, slightly different than they are in America, but everything falls back to WCAG.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. Thank you. You mentioned in the notes that we exchanged prior to recording this, that there are some, some ways that you can make this job easier for yourself. And you talk particularly about some design patterns that you feel will be able to assist people who, perhaps having listened to this podcast, think, okay, this is something I need to be mindful of. Just run us through what these design patterns are. That may take a long time, I don&#8217;t know. You might have a quick version or it may be a long version. I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:25] <strong>Christina Deemer:</strong> Yeah, in the April 2021 working group note, it mentions dozens of different design patterns. And um, I really encourage people to check that out. Of course, read this spec and look at the working group node and understand all of the different things. But a couple of sort of top things for me are making your content as clear as possible. And a lot of times people think of content as post content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But content is everything that&#8217;s on your site. So it includes button text, it includes how the content in a menu, it includes instructions, it includes headings, and it&#8217;s important that all of that is as clear as possible. So if you have multiple CTAs on a page, if you have a CTA for subscribing, what does subscribing mean? What are you subscribing to? Versus registering for a newsletter. You need to make sure that the CTA for registering for the newsletter, versus subscribing to a publication, that they have a separate CTA. That it&#8217;s clear that you&#8217;re doing two different actions here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we talked about readability a minute ago, making sure that you&#8217;re using short sentences with simple common words. That is helpful. And that you&#8217;re using punctuation intentionally, which sounds like a small thing but using punctuation intentionally, like a period when you mean to use a period and using commas. That&#8217;s helpful for, clear content is important for SEO as well. And it helps with users who use screen readers, which includes people with cognitive disabilities who are more comfortable hearing the text, the content, than reading it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while a blind person who does not have a cognitive disability may be able to work out the meaning of something that&#8217;s not formatted correctly. Somebody who has communication issues may not be able to work out what the meaning of the content is, if it&#8217;s not formatted correctly. So the clear content is one. Using clear step by step instructions for something is important. A lot of times we give users feedback only when they&#8217;re making a mistake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s important to give them a little help before they&#8217;ve made a mistake in a form. Give them an example of how you want a telephone number formatted. Or like where they can find if a username is actually a user&#8217;s email address, make that clear to the user before they&#8217;ve tried to submit the form and they&#8217;ve made a mistake. Those little bits of instructions sometimes can seem unnecessary or they&#8217;re cluttering up the site. If you feel like they&#8217;re cluttering up the site, you can hide the instructions round like a little eye icon or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that I think is particularly important is not making the user have to remember. If a user wants to upgrade their subscription or change their service plan. They should know what their current plan is, how much it costs, when it is set to expire. They shouldn&#8217;t have to remember that when they&#8217;re being asked to upgrade to another plan. So that&#8217;s another one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you see that with a number of cases where, you are asked to upgrade and you&#8217;re like what plan am I even on right now? Am I on a particularly high plan? How much money am I, how much extra am I spending to upgrade my plan? And it can be confusing to users. So like, just give them everything that they need on every single screen. That&#8217;s a lot better for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those are some more concrete things. And then there are some more sort of conceptual design patterns around things like making sure that a user&#8217;s most important tasks are featured prominently on a site. What are a user&#8217;s most important tasks? Do you even know what a user&#8217;s most important tasks are on your site?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The example I give in my talk is that, you know if you have a library and the team thinks that the most important thing is getting users to sign up for an event, and it takes two clicks for the users to sign up for the event at the library. But, if you look at the usage data, or focus groups, or user testing, like a user&#8217;s most important tasks may be figuring out what the library hours are. Signing up for a library card. But maybe to do that you have to click on a bunch of different links and maybe even have to search or something to find out what the library hours are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you may have to sort of reconcile what the user&#8217;s most important tasks are versus what the team considers the most important. But that&#8217;s only possible when you actually know what your users want to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It feels like there&#8217;s a whole subset, and I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m not saying that this is the norm, but I think there&#8217;s a subset of people out there who quite deliberately go out of their way to make things as confusing as possible. So an example that just comes to mind recently is I purchased a flight, and the process of completing the flight purchase was extraordinarily challenging. In that I couldn&#8217;t get to the end of it without declining hundreds of different things. I simply wanted a flight, but then came the insurance and the, do you want the hotel at the other end? And do you want the car and all of this? I was just completely overloaded by the whole thing. Getting really frustrated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:37] <strong>Christina Deemer:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And I thought, but this is intentional. This has been designed to, in a sense, trip me up. Because the button that I wanted to press, which was continue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:47] <strong>Christina Deemer:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Was masked, and the button which was going to sell me the insurance was large and colorful and obvious. And I feel that there&#8217;s a sort of subset of the internet where they&#8217;re trying to do exactly the opposite of what you&#8217;re describing, because, maybe it&#8217;s profit, maybe that&#8217;s all it is. It&#8217;s as simple as that. So that must be frustrating, shall we say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:05] <strong>Christina Deemer:</strong> Yes, a design pattern, an accessible design pattern, is to make critical paths as short as possible. Anything that can be optional, buying the insurance, upgrading your seat, should be something that happens after you&#8217;ve completed the initial purchase. Because it&#8217;s so easy for users to get distracted. It&#8217;s so easy for users to get confused about what button to push. And again there&#8217;s that tension between accessibility needs and business needs. And I really wonder like, I would want to look at the data. Is this really effective for them?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do they know? Would it be more effective for users if they were allowed to choose whether or not to buy the insurance or upgrade their seat, after they&#8217;ve completed their purchase and feel good about that, and then have the option to like do all of these other things. And then you know that the user isn&#8217;t going to, is less likely to abandon their task, and then they haven&#8217;t even purchased the ticket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I feel also that the language often is deliberately obfuscating what it is that is intended. So you know you get like double negatives, and if you do not wish to achieve such a thing, tick this box. And actually just have to spend a moment thinking about it. Hang on, what does that even mean? Do I want to tick that box or not? And give it a moment&#8217;s thought and it comes to you. But I guess those trip wires are just really frustrating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:25] <strong>Christina Deemer:</strong> Yeah. And imagine like a user who struggles with reading comprehension issues, managing a sentence with double negatives. Maybe it&#8217;s hard enough for them to just parse the content in the first place, let alone battle that double negative. And maybe they think they&#8217;ve done the right thing and have said that they don&#8217;t want the insurance, but then they find out that they&#8217;ve actually purchased it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then they feel exhausted. They feel embarrassed and frustrated. And maybe reluctant to say anything because they don&#8217;t want to admit that they made a mistake and didn&#8217;t understand the content. It personally makes me feel very frustrated and angry that people maybe intentionally like praying upon people who are disabled. It is, for a lot of people, it may be just a matter of okay, I&#8217;ve gotta take a moment, figure this out. What do I wanna do? And it may just be an inconvenience or a nuisance. But for some people those kinds of barriers, it really can take a toll on people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, and I feel the flight example, albeit was easy to understand, it&#8217;s not an essential part of my life. But if I was acquiring something which was utterly critical, trying to access healthcare or something and wasn&#8217;t thought through, and I really need to get this form finished yesterday. Those things do matter and so putting the time in to make it as straightforward as possible. It feels like, the word that&#8217;s coming into my head here is, clarity, simplicity, those kind of things. Just keep it as straightforward and as easy to understand as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:58] <strong>Christina Deemer:</strong> Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You mentioned that you wanted to talk about in this podcast interview, that you have autism and how this actually impacts you. I don&#8217;t wanna lead you off in any particular direction, so I&#8217;m just gonna ask you if you want to just describe the experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:14] <strong>Christina Deemer:</strong> Sure. So I am late diagnosed autistic person. I was diagnosed in March of 2020. So like right as the pandemic started. It was a turbulent time for me. But I also have, I have multiple family members who are autistic and the more I learned about autism, the more I found myself relating to a lot of the things that were talked about. And things like having trouble reading social cues, having some very rigid routines, getting really involved in some special interests and a number of other things, but those are some top things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a sort of funny thing is that people have told me, they&#8217;re like, hey, you don&#8217;t look autistic. And I&#8217;m like, what does that even mean? Does that mean that I&#8217;m not, I don&#8217;t look like the sort of stereotype for an autistic person as a young white boy who likes trains? And granted, trains are awesome, I do like trains. And I do love Star Trek, especially like the autistic coded characters like Spock and Data and Seven Of Nine. But like, autistic people look like people. There are women who are autistic, there are black people who are autistic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think the other thing is that I&#8217;m good at masking, and masking is where autistic people sort of adopt neurotypical traits to fit in. And that is something that a lot of people, especially people who are socialized as girls, get accustomed to doing. So like there&#8217;s that. But I am autistic. Autistic people look a bunch of different ways. I wanted to take advantage of this platform, this opportunity to address that misconception about what autistic people look like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And earlier we were talking about my experience on the web. What that looks like and how my autism can inform that or what barriers I experience. And a couple of things came to mind, and one is that definitely like any autoplay content, like autoplay media, or auto play video auto play audio, animations that are not functional, it can feel to me like I&#8217;m intending to step into a library and I&#8217;ve, and I walk into a rave. That is how it feels. It feels very loud and bright. And that is no knock on raves, everybody likes a good rave sometimes. But you wanna give people the opportunity to like turn off the music, and turn off the flashing lights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a thing that I really hope people can do is, if you have some auto play thing. A, don&#8217;t auto play anything in the first place, it&#8217;s very inaccessible, but like always give users the opportunity to personalize, and turn those things off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the other one is like very similar in that it&#8217;s flashing and flickering content. And that can feel like looking at the sun. I can feel pain in my eyes, from flashing and flickering content. And it doesn&#8217;t have to be that super fast flash that can trigger seizures in photosensitive people. It can just be like, a little too much flash. I can feel it in my eyes and I can have even that like startled physical reaction to it. And that&#8217;s just me personally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think there are a lot of other people who may have different responses to things on the web and, and I&#8217;m fortunate enough that I can, on my team, and this is why it&#8217;s great to have diverse teams, is like when we&#8217;re building content, when we&#8217;re building websites, I can help guide us and say, or help give that feedback about auto playing things and put my foot down and say we are not going to build this in a way that is inaccessible. We are not going to build this animation that seems cute, doesn&#8217;t have any functionality or whatever, but I know is going to like ruin somebody&#8217;s day or whatever, just because they accidentally like encountered this webpage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Really fascinating. You are educating me in an area that I genuinely don&#8217;t have much contact with. So it&#8217;s really fascinating. Given everything that you&#8217;ve just said, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s gonna be a proportion of people who have woken up to this, during the listening of this, and thinking to themselves, okay, how do I find out more? So just for those of us who are starting on this journey, just give us some idea of where the resources might lie. Where might we go? Who might we speak to? Which organizations? So that could be online, or a book, or an organization, whatever you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:22] <strong>Christina Deemer:</strong> I think if you&#8217;re interested in learning more about accessibility, there are a few organizations that do a pretty good job with providing accessibility education. The first is the company Deque, they make an accessibility testing extension, but they also offer really great courses and training and have a lot of just general resources on their website. They even have a great resource library of accessible components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s Knowbility, which is spelled k n o w b i l i t y. Also has a number of great webinars and they have a conference, so a great place to go for resources. There&#8217;s a really great community on Twitter, on accessibility, Twitter. There are a number of experts there, and I&#8217;m always a big fan of if you really want to understand accessibility, you&#8217;ve gotta read the specs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And actually, it&#8217;s ironic but when some of the April, 2021 working group note that I keep referencing, when that came out, some folks criticized it online saying, this document itself isn&#8217;t very accessible. It&#8217;s very, very extensive, very thorough, very meaty. And so they went back, God bless them, they went back and they made the document itself more accessible. They added some icons which help with scanning the document. They added some more use cases and examples, so people could better understand how these things work in real life. So it&#8217;s a lot. I think it&#8217;s actually the working group note on cognitive accessibility, I think is actually sometimes easier to parse than WCAG itself, in terms of the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I also want people to understand that there are probably some accessibility champions in your network. You may have somebody on your team or in your company who has a good understanding of maybe how accessibility intersects with your product or your sector. And talk to those people. I learned a lot about accessibility from the agency I work for called Alley. Shout out to Kevin and Owen, who both really mentored me and helped me really level up my accessibility knowledge. So like use the people that you have in your network. They really want to talk to you about these things. So I hope that&#8217;s helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s really helpful. But also just to know that this is an area where there are actual jobs. There are people who do this, who would like to assist you. There&#8217;s probably somebody in your local area who takes this all very seriously, and would be willing to speak to you on the phone. It&#8217;s not just, okay, I heard a podcast, I can forget about it now. There are calls to be made and people to meet who will help you with this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:54] <strong>Christina Deemer:</strong> Absolutely, and so I don&#8217;t do accessibility full time at my job. I&#8217;m a developer. So there may be accessibility champions who are developers in your organization. There may be people who are designers who work in content, who work in strategy. The awesome thing about accessibility is that it touches all areas of the product. And, there are also people, yes professionals who focus exclusively on accessibility and who can do things like perform an audit of your product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you are starting from zero on this, a lot of times those people can be the best people to reach out to because they are going to give you that comprehensive look that includes content design, you know development, all strategy, like all aspects of accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You mentioned that you work for . A company called Alley. I&#8217;ll link in the show notes. Your agency isn&#8217;t uniquely focusing on this area?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:48] <strong>Christina Deemer:</strong> No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s a web design agency?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:51] <strong>Christina Deemer:</strong> Yeah. So the Alley Group is an agency that works with a lot of enterprise level publishers. And I work for a company within the Alley group called Lead, and we&#8217;re a platform for mid and small size independent publishers. But accessibility is something that the Alley group takes very seriously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We work with a lot of very large publications. So we have to make sure that we get this right for them, and the millions of people who visit those websites. And we are hiring. If you&#8217;re interested in joining a group that takes accessibility very seriously, please visit alley.co/careers. We are always hiring software developers and have a number of other positions available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> This is such an interesting subject. I feel that we could go on for hours more. But Christina Deemer, thank you so much. Is there a place where you are comfortable people connecting directly with you? It may be Twitter or email?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:44] <strong>Christina Deemer:</strong> Yeah, you can find me on twitter at c a h d e e m e r. And this was so much fun. It went by so fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you so much for joining us. I&#8217;m really hoping that it&#8217;s gonna have opened some people&#8217;s eyes to something, which seems to be incredibly important. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:00] <strong>Christina Deemer:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cahdeemer\">Christina Deemer</a>. Christina is a senior UX developer at <a href=\"https://joinlede.com/\">Lede</a>, a company of the <a href=\"https://alley.com/\">Alley Group</a>, where she champions accessibility and headless WordPress in her work with publishers and nonprofits. She&#8217;s passionate about inclusivity and community and has spoken at a variety of events about the subject.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christina is autistic and brings her personal experience with neurodivergence and disability to bear in her work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the recent WordCamp US, Christina gave a <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2022/session/embracing-minds-of-all-kinds/\">presentation</a> called &#8220;embracing minds of all kinds, making digital content usable for people with cognitive disabilities&#8221;. And it&#8217;s this talk which is the foundation of the podcast today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In her description of the presentation, Christina wrote, &#8220;cognitive disabilities are among the most prevalent types of disabilities, yet experts have struggled to provide web accessibility best practices around this area due to cognitive disabilities being such a broad category. However recent work by standards groups has begun to address this deficiency&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In past episodes, we&#8217;ve covered website accessibility from some different angles, and today we focus on how the web might be experienced by people with cognitive disabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, Christina talks about what the term cognitive disabilities actually means, and what it encompasses. It&#8217;s a wide range of things, and so we talk about how people may differ in the way that they access the web. Memory, over complicated interfaces and readability are a few of the areas that we touch upon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also discuss what legislation there is in place to offer guidance to those wishing to make their sites more accessible, and as you&#8217;ll hear, it&#8217;s a changing landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end, Christina talks about her own late diagnosis of autism and how this shapes her experience of the web, particularly with auto-play content and when web design includes elements which flash or flicker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, when we record the podcast, there&#8217;s not a lot of background noise, but that&#8217;s not always the case. This is the last of the live recordings from WordCamp US 2022, and you may notice that the recordings have a little echo or other strange audio artifacts. Whilst the podcasts are more than listenable, I do hope that you understand that the vagaries of the real world were at play.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.deque.com/\">Deque</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://knowbility.org/\">Knowbility</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/\">WCAG</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/\">W3C Working Group Note 29 April 2021</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"Do The Woo Community: The Flexibility of the WP-CLI Configuration Files\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=73110\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"https://dothewoo.io/devlife_snippet-the-flexibility-of-the-wp-cli-configuration-files/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:401:\"<p>For those special projects, you could set multiple WP-CLI config files in various places.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/devlife_snippet-the-flexibility-of-the-wp-cli-configuration-files/\">The Flexibility of the WP-CLI Configuration Files</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 10:13:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"HeroPress: A Community That Transcends Labels\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=4922\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:142:\"https://heropress.com/essays/a-community-that-transcends-labels/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=a-community-that-transcends-labels\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18134:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/102522-min.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: WordPress is an incredible opportunity to build a successful business that is flexible enough to give me the lifestyle I want.\" />\nHere is Katie reading her own story aloud.\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has changed my life in so many ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the story of how I discovered WordPress and used it to build a business that gives me financial freedom and a flexible lifestyle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s the story of how the unique nature of the WordPress community has allowed me to achieve my dreams, without the obstacles and prejudices which are common in other industries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s the story of how I haven’t achieved this “despite” being a woman founder and a mother. And how it wasn’t “because of” these things either. Instead, it was because of the incredible WordPress community which transcends these labels.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-the-beginning-building-a-career-without-a-goal\">The Beginning &#8211; Building a Career Without a Goal</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve always been extremely motivated and hard working, getting top marks at school and University. However, as a child I never knew what I wanted to be when I grew up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone around me seemed to have specific ambitions to work towards. My sister wanted to be a doctor. My Mum had always wanted to be a doctor too. My Dad had always wanted to be a TV producer. And surprise surprise, they all achieved those goals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I was different, as I had never seen a job that I wanted to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>It felt like there was something wrong with me.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Careers advisors tried to force me into a category. This was normally very basic, for example: “You’re good at writing, you should be a journalist” &#8211; regardless of the fact that I obviously didn’t have the right personality type for that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it didn’t really matter because I was hard working enough to do well at whatever I tried, and I didn’t feel I <em>needed</em> a specific purpose &#8211; whatever other people thought. I chose my favorite subjects to study at University (English Literature and Philosophy), focussing on the skills it would give me rather than what career it would lead to. And when I graduated in 2002, I applied for a range of jobs where I felt like I had the required skills. It took about 20 attempts, but eventually I got a job offer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn’t enjoy my first job, which was being a Technical Writer for a software company. After that, I got a job as a Trainee Manager for a relatively small company &#8211; and that’s when things started to get interesting. I discovered that by being enthusiastic and showing my potential, I could mould the job around my skills rather than the other way round. I’m good at research and writing, so the company gave me responsibilities in those areas and let me take over the company newsletter, communication and marketing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, every role I’ve had (including at Barn2) has evolved around my skills and experience. This makes it much more interesting, as well as more useful to the company! I realised that you don’t need a specific career goal. Instead, you can just focus on what you’re good at and where your interests lie, and everyone benefits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-the-drive-to-do-more\">The Drive to Do More</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When I started my career, I absolutely did not have the skills or independence to start my own company. The UK education system does nothing to encourage budding entrepreneurs, or even to acknowledge entrepreneurship as a possible career option. My path had always been to go to University and then “get a job”.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it was the early 2000’s and the world was changing. I could see the internet taking the world by storm and creating opportunities that had never existed before. I enviously watched people who were becoming successful by building innovative online businesses. I didn’t just want their success &#8211; I wanted the flexible lifestyles that they were achieving by working for themselves.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>My husband Andy and I talked endlessly about how we wanted to stop working for other people and start a business together.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>However, neither of us were big risk-takers or “big ideas” people. As a result, we stayed in our jobs for the rest of our 20’s, feeling more and more fed up and longing for more freedom.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-discovering-wordpress-while-becoming-a-mother\">Discovering WordPress While Becoming a Mother</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, in 2009/10 we agreed for Andy to quit his job to start a web design company. The plan was for him to do the technical work, while I would do the marketing, content and SEO alongside my main job. My salary was just about enough to support both of us through the early days, so while it was the biggest risk we had ever taken, it wasn’t a huge gamble.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Andy was a Senior Software Developer, he had to teach himself web design and PHP. We chose to start a web design business because it felt like an easy market to enter, and would nicely combine his technical abilities with my business and marketing skills. We didn’t have the confidence to start a business that required large upfront investment or a higher level of risk.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While our initial focus was designing websites for small local businesses, Andy discovered WordPress during our first project. He immediately realized that it was the best way to build any type of website. I remember being sceptical when he first told me about it because it sounded like a template-based blogging platform, but he was absolutely right! We used it for all our clients’ websites.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2011, our daughter Sophia was born.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Surprisingly, being a mother actually helped me to build the business.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Andy and I had felt comfortable reducing our income to one salary, but it was much scarier for us both to quit our jobs. After all, that was the point where our finances would be completely reliant on the business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, becoming a mother eased this transition because my income naturally reduced during my year’s maternity leave. My parents were amazingly helpful while Sophia was a baby, giving me the opportunity to breast-feed every couple of hours while working on the business in between (and often at the same time!). It was also nice having Andy working from home, which meant that I got more help and felt less alone with the baby than if he had to go out to work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn’t easy. When Sophia was little, I always felt that she was different from other babies but when I raised my concerns, people told me not to be silly. At 6 months old, it became more obvious and she was diagnosed with a rare form of childhood epilepsy along with a lot of uncertainty for the future. I have never been so disappointed to be proved right! Sophia was given strong medication which made her very ill. Luckily the medication worked, but it was a terrifying time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Sophia’s illness made me realise how important it is to have flexible work that can fit around your lifestyle.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>While Andy and I did less work during this period, we still kept moving forward with some projects. I remember discussing one client’s website in a hospital waiting room! This helped to take our mind off things, while also helping to pay the bills. I’m not sure how we would have copied if we had traditional jobs where we were expected to be in the office.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it was time to finish maternity leave and return to my previous job, I wanted to quit and stay with Barn2 full-time, but was still too scared to make the commitment. Fortunately, ‘fate’ made the decision for me because my employer decided to withdraw all their family-friendly policies with no notice. They refused to allow me to work part-time, while at the same time trying to downgrade my role and reduce my salary by about 40%! To make a long story short, this created the perfect opportunity to jump head first into the business, which I wouldn’t have had the confidence to do otherwise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that, the web design business grew quickly. We grew a name for ourselves as one of the only UK companies specializing in WordPress, and had clients all over the world. You can read about this in more detail in my previous HeroPress essay, “<a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/building-a-new-life/\">Building a New Life</a>”.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-the-switch-to-wordpress-plugins\">The Switch to WordPress Plugins</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>True to form, after a few years of building a successful client-facing web design agency, I wanted more. Client work was very demanding in terms of time and commitment, and it was difficult to take time off work. I hired freelance designers and developers to help with the workload, but was managing more projects than I could handle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, Andy and I took a month off work to travel around France in a motorhome. It was the last chance to do this during term time as our daughter Sophia was about to start school. One of my freelance project managers looked after our clients and I tried to switch off for once. Unfortunately, that didn’t work out and I returned home to a lot of unhappy clients! One project completely imploded while I was away, and I remember responding to some very stressful emails by the pool at one campsite.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As owner of a WordPress agency, I was very familiar with a range of WordPress themes and plugins. I watched the big product companies with envy, such as Gravity Forms, The Events Calendar, and others. I could see that selling WordPress products would bring even more lifestyle benefits than client work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>After spending a year trying and failing to get a theme accepted onto ThemeForest, we decided to start building plugins.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>We figured that plugins could be simpler and more defined than themes, and were therefore more realistic for a single developer to build. We looked around for ideas, and found them in a range of places.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our first plugin was released in March 2016 &#8211; <a href=\"https://barn2.com/wordpress-plugins/woocommerce-protected-categories/\">WooCommerce Protected Categories</a>. We had seen on the WooCommerce Ideas forum that there was demand for a plugin like this, and at that time nothing like it existed. It was relatively straightforward to develop and because it was so niche, I felt confident in how to market it. Despite this, we were still amazed to get our first sale a few days after launching. It actually felt like maybe we could build a product business after all!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-tables-tables-and-more-tables\">Tables, Tables, and More Tables</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The second plugin was <a href=\"https://barn2.com/wordpress-plugins/posts-table-pro\">Posts Table Pro</a>, which was a more advanced version of a plugin that we had built to list a client’s blog posts in a table. We had released it as a free plugin, which was an excellent opportunity because people started sending us feature requests that we could use to build more plugins. This directly led to the development of <a href=\"https://barn2.com/wordpress-plugins/woocommerce-product-table/\">WooCommerce Product Table</a>, which has turned over more than $1,500,000 since its launch, and our current bestselling plugin <a href=\"https://barn2.com/wordpress-plugins/document-library-pro/\">Document Library Pro</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these plugins are similar in that they list information from the WordPress database in a searchable table with filters. However, people use them for radically different purposes and each plugin is tailored to a specific use case.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>We never planned to become a table plugin company &#8211; it just happened over time, as a result of adding one free plugin to wordpress.org.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that’s how a lot of businesses work &#8211; you try one thing, and that opens doors to more opportunities. It’s the same as my career &#8211; I tried a few things and let them evolve in their natural direction. The most important thing is that you put yourself out there and get things done.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-growing-barn2-plugins-and-moving-abroad\">Growing Barn2 Plugins, and Moving Abroad</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin business has continued to grow. We’ve released more and more plugins, mostly specializing in WooCommerce. We’ve built a team, which currently consists of more than 14 people.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Andy and I have taken advantage of the freedoms that we have built for ourselves. For example, last year we moved from the UK to the sunny island of Mallorca in Spain!</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I work when I realistically can, and I also take time out to do fun things like hiking in the mountains, or paddleboarding in the sea.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I try to be an active part of the WordPress community, for example attending WordCamps and building partnerships with other WordPress companies. I talk to people who run similar companies every day, and hope that I help them as much as they help me. Working together like this helps everyone to grow &#8211; the aim is to complement each other’s work rather than competing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-being-a-woman-founder-in-wordpress\">Being a Woman Founder in WordPress</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve never had a problem being in a male dominated environment. As a teenager, my best friends were boys despite the fact that I went to an all-girls school. At a school parents’ evening, my teacher said that I had a “male mind” &#8211; whatever that means! As a student, I lived with Andy and 3 other guys. Before having children, most of my friends were men. So maybe ending up in a male-dominated industry is no coincidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I can only talk about my own experiences, and I have never experienced any issues from being a woman in WordPress. A lot of companies aim to be “color blind” and I can’t really comment on this, but I would describe the WordPress community as “gender blind”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, most of the people who run WordPress product companies are men, and so are most of the people at WordCamps. Most of my WordPress friends are men. However, I don’t think that’s due to discrimination because the community is 100% welcoming to the women who do choose to join. In fact, it is rare for people I meet to even acknowledge any sort of gender difference &#8211; even people I know well. Everyone is just treated equally, regardless of gender.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, the most marginalized that I have ever felt is by other women, and by people who are trying to promote gender equality. For example, at WordCamp Europe this year, another woman founder asked me if I work at Barn2 or if I’m just here with my husband! I have never, ever been asked a question like that by a man in the WordPress community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At WordCamp US this year, I spent almost the entire time with men and not one person drew attention to the fact that I was a different gender. As a result, I resented having my pronouns written in huge letters on my name tag! I realise this is largely in support of people in the LGBTQIA+ community but for me, it was the first time that the WordPress community had ever made a point of my gender, and felt uncomfortable and counter-productive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, most people feel imposter syndrome at some point, and I’m no exception. I wonder whether people only invite me on podcasts and to join groups because they want a token woman. Equally, I wonder if people respect me less because I’m not a developer. However, those are my own personal hangups and with a couple of tiny exceptions, no one has ever done anything to make me feel this way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-what-does-wordpress-mean-to-me\">What Does WordPress Mean To Me?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most industries &#8211; including tech industries &#8211; demand long hours and huge levels of commitment. It’s much harder to work <em>and </em>have a life. For me, WordPress is an incredible opportunity to build a successful business that is flexible enough to give me the lifestyle I want. I work hard when I choose to work hard. I relax when I want to relax. It’s my choice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The barriers to entry are incredibly low, and you don’t need any specific qualifications to get started with WordPress. Most people in the industry work remotely, which brings a much better work-life balance for both the founders and team members. Everything is done online, which makes it easier to bootstrap a business with minimal investment. And yet despite this flexibility, the market is absolutely huge and you can find real success with WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of people think that the WordPress industry is changing due to the spate of acquisitions over the past few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Some product company owners feel like they will be left behind unless they join one of the big players. However, as the owner of a self-owned plugin company, I haven’t seen any evidence of this.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re continuing to grow and thrive. In fact, being independent has advantages because I can make decisions and move quickly, without any red tape.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as the opportunities it brings, WordPress is an incredibly inclusive place to build a business. It does this in a natural, unintentional way where people can just “be”, without being judged. And that’s the best way.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/a-community-that-transcends-labels/\">A Community That Transcends Labels</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 06:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Katie Keith\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"WPTavern: WordPress Accessibility Day 2022 Publishes Speaker Lineup\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=138914\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-accessibility-day-2022-publishes-speaker-lineup\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2639:\"<p><a href=\"https://wpaccessibility.day/\">WordPress Accessibility Day</a> is just one week away on November 2-3, and registration is still open.

The color palette is dark with a bright lemon-yellow accent color. It&#8217;s bold without being overly splashy, making it suitable for professional use cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arc FSE does not come with any style variations, but users can easily change the accent colors for buttons, headings, and anything else by editing the templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The theme comes with 20 custom patterns, which make up different sections of the design. They are all conveniently grouped together under &#8220;Arc FSE&#8221; in the Patterns explorer, so you don&#8217;t have to hunt for the ones that belong to the theme. It includes full-page patterns for the home, about, services, and portfolio pages. There are also section patterns for things like the default footer, 404 page, a promotional video, sidebar, search cover block, services, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>When first installing Arc FSE, the home page is set up to be nearly identical to <a href=\"https://demo.olivethemes.com/?demo=arc-fse\">the demo</a>, making it easy for users to get started customizing. It would be helpful to have a style guide for the theme, but for the most part you get what you see with the demo for the free version. Olive Themes also makes a <a href=\"https://olivethemes.com/wordpress-themes/arc-pro/\">pro version</a>, which includes additional features, WooCommerce support, and more blocks for things like testimonials and star ratings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arc FSE is good option for businesses, agencies, foundations, or artists with portfolios. After less than a week, it&#8217;s already being used on more than 100 sites. The theme is available to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/arc-fse/\">download</a> for free on WordPress.org. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 02:55:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 6.1 Release Candidate 3 (RC3) Now Available\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13670\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/10/wordpress-6-1-release-candidate-3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6611:\"<p>Release Candidate 3 (RC3) is now available for testing!

The navigation is jumpy and confusing, especially when going from template browsing to template editing to modifying individual blocks. A large PR is in progress for redesigning this UI with the introduction of a &#8220;browse mode&#8221; that would <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/james-koster-shares-design-explorations-that-transform-wordpress-site-editor-into-a-more-visual-user-friendly-tool\">make the experience feel more like a design tool</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg lead engineer Riad Benguella <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/44770\">opened the PR</a> as a continuation of the ongoing work on this project, which has its roots in <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/23328\">ideas</a> and explorations that have been fermenting since 2019. He shared a video that roughly demonstrates the target for the proposed UI changes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>It essentially introduces a “navigable frame” where users can select from a menu of features on the left. More detailed efforts on improving the animations and placement of the menu items is happening simultaneously within the ticket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The original idea was to include the &#8220;Navigation menu&#8221; item inside the sidebar, but Benguella removed it in favor of keeping the PR contained to simply adding the &#8220;edit/view&#8221; mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although such a large PR has the potential to introduce a slew of regressions, Benguella said there is no other way around a big PR due to the the necessity of the structural changes to how the site editor is organized. He is attempting to keep it narrowly focused and not try to tackle features like browsing capabilities and adding UI (template lists, global styles, etc) to the sidebar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is not without <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/44770#issuecomment-1281312589\">some pushback</a>. Alex Stine, Cloud Platform Engineer at Waystar, warned against introducing another Mode into Gutenberg, saying it &#8220;feels kind of reckless considering we haven&#8217;t refined existing modes for all users.&#8221; He noted that Gutenberg already has select/edit mode contexts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This was a feature basically added for screen readers only,&#8221; Stine said. &#8220;I am hoping this will one day be removed, but we&#8217;re not quite there yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think the community is trying to solve the wrong problem. If Gutenberg itself did not have such a complex UI, there would not be the need for a hundred different modes in a hundred different contexts, blocks, or even editors. We have gone so crazy making everything so quickly, no one thought about how to unify the interface across all editors. This feels like it could be another patch to a bigger problem.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stine cautioned against growing the UI for something that ultimately doesn&#8217;t make things any simpler.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In a sense this PR doesn&#8217;t introduce any new mode, it just redesigns the current navigation panel a bit,&#8221; Benguella <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/44770#issuecomment-1281319290\">said</a> in response. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s an opportunity to improve the a11y of the navigation in the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The confusion in this PR is that it&#8217;s not about another mode in the editor itself, it&#8217;s higher level, it&#8217;s how we choose which template and template part to edit before actually entering the editor.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the project&#8217;s contributors have been referring to it as &#8220;browse mode,&#8221; it is essentially a redesign for the existing UI to make it more intuitive for users to navigate. Gutenberg may not need any more new &#8220;modes&#8221; but the site editor is in dire need design improvements that will unify the experience and make it less chaotic for getting around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the most <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/24/editor-chat-summary-wednesday-20-october-2022/\">recent core Editor meeting</a>, Gutenberg contributors called for feedback on the big PR, since it has so many moving parts and needs more scrutiny. It&#8217;s not ready to land in the next release of Gutenberg yet, but the concept is rapidly taking shape and may expand to include more features in the sidebar once the basic structure is in place.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 04:14:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"Do The Woo Community: The Power of WooCommerce Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=73101\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"https://dothewoo.io/the-power-of-woocommerce-blocks/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:374:\"<p>The WooCommerce team is actively exploring the interplay of block themes and full site editing within a Woo store.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/the-power-of-woocommerce-blocks/\">The Power of WooCommerce Blocks</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 09:01:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"Gutenberg Times: What art can you create with WordPress 6.1?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=22528\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/what-art-can-you-create-with-wordpress-6-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4422:\"<p>Over the last year, the <a href=\"https://href.li/?https://block-museum.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Museum of Block Art</a> was launched, built by and for the WordPress community.

The catalog has now indexed more than 800,000 audio files and its development team has taken audio support out of beta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Openverse visitors can now confidently search for and explore audio files for use in their videos, podcasts, or other creative projects, all available for free use under Creative Commons licenses. It is an incredible resource that is expanding and improving every day. Users can search on any device, but I found that Openverse audio searches and files are surprisingly easy to navigate on mobile.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Search results can be filtered by permitted use, license, audio category, extension, duration, and source. Previewing works well and each file has attribution information readily available to copy. Clicking on &#8220;Get this audio&#8221; will take the visitor to the file on the external collection&#8217;s website where it can be downloaded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deeper integration with WordPress core is on the roadmap for Openverse files. It would also be interesting to see WordPress&#8217; core Audio block integrate access to Openverse, in addition to pulling files from URL or the media library, the same way the Image block allows users to browse Openverse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg contributors are currently exploring how they can <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/44496\">add basic Openverse integration to the inserter</a>. Matias Ventura, lead architect of Gutenberg, has proposed adding a Media tab to the existing tabs for Blocks, Patterns, and Reusable blocks, which allow dragging and dropping content into the canvas. This would offer more convenient access to the media library while building pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The inserter panel should support the ability to drag media from the inserter into the canvas, including dragging into block placeholders to quickly update patterns and such with your own content,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;The Media tab would allow users to choose between categorized assets from the media library, and from Openverse.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg engineer Nik Tsekouras created <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/44424\">a PR with a prototype</a>, basically a proof-of-concept, to explore how this might be implemented.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Development is still in the exploration and early stages, but this looks like a promising new integration that would make it easy for WordPress users to tap into Openverse&#8217;s catalog of 600 million free creative works.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 22 Oct 2022 02:03:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"Post Status: New Venue Accessibility Checklist in the WordCamp Organizer Handbook\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=141561\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://poststatus.com/new-venue-accessibility-checklist-in-the-wordcamp-organizer-handbook/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3496:\"<h2 id=\"h-wordpress-community-news-roundup-for-the-week-of-october-17\">WordPress Community News Roundup for the Week of October 17</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You may recall my prior post, <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/5-days-without-a-shower/\">5 Days Without a Shower</a>, in which I wrote about my disability experiences at <strong>WCUS 2022</strong>. Writing things from a place of vulnerability isn’t always easy, but sometimes they’re necessary. Creating that post gave you insight into my experiences, and though I told them with a thread of humor, it was still not easy to share. But sharing with good intent, and with support, can help effect change. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week the <strong>WCUS 2023</strong> team reached out to me in two ways, and when I tell you how warmed my heart was, you <em>still</em> can’t imagine the extent of my joy. First, <strong>Joe Simpson Jr.</strong> shared this new section of the <strong>WordCamp Organizer Handbook</strong> with me: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/first-steps/venue-accessibility-checklist/\">Venue Accessibility Checklist</a>. This is a HUGE step toward accommodating those with disabilities at WordCamps. The team also reached out to me as they’re touring the venue for next year with questions as they went through, inviting my input. Kudos to the Community Team on these great efforts and forward momentum.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><strong>Black Friday and Cyber Monday</strong> are coming quickly! <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/submit-black-friday-cyber-monday-deals/\">Submit your deals on our site</a>.

The temporary loss of active install stats at WordPress.org has created an opportunity to rethink long-held assumptions and find new ways forward, so maybe it\'s not surprising that we made nearly the same selections. There\'s a single throughline in this episode — what works, what doesn\'t, and what will take WordPress businesses forward in the product, agency, and hosting spaces. A lot of people are thinking down this track and a lot of good ideas are coming forward. We\'ve tried to pull together the ones we feel are best. <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/building-supporting-and-selling-a-winning-product-with-or-without-wordpress-org/\">LISTEN or READ →</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Are Active Install Counts Relevant to Your Business\'s Success? (Even if they are accurate?)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In “<a href=\"https://getellipsis.com/blog/org-is-ineffective-plugin-distribution/\">WordPress.org is ineffective for plugin distribution in 2022</a>,” <strong>Alex Denning</strong> argues the likely temporary loss of <strong>Active Install Growth</strong> data for plugin owners is not a bottom-line, business-relevant concern. Apart from the revelation that that data itself was not just obfuscated and inexact but “<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/discussion-on-replacing-plugin-active-install-growth-data-continues-behind-closed-doors\">basically garbage</a>,” Alex draws on <strong>Ellipsis</strong>&#8216; marketing experience and extensive data (as well as <strong>Iain Poulson</strong>&#8216;s <a href=\"https://s.wptrends.co/w/kWJrSn4PAY2Xziux1YiYEQ\">insights</a> at <strong>WP Trends</strong>) to show 1-2% conversion rates are the norm for plugins in the WP.org repository. Only a couple of big players can crack the 100k+ install tiers today.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Let\'s Fix What\'s Broken (The Plugin Repo) Not What Isn\'t (The Freemium Model)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Cromwell </strong>politely disagrees with Alex as he makes <a href=\"https://www.mattcromwell.com/the-case-for-the-wordpress-plugin-freemium-model/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Case for the WordPress Plugin Freemium Model</a>. (There\'s a great <a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/C0413T6GD/p1666180505764299\">Post Status Slack thread</a> on it too.) In it, Matt describes ways plugin owners can make the plugin repository\'s search engine work better for them, but Matt also notes a few of its deficiencies as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As <strong>Justin Labadie</strong> and others <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/connect-freemium-plugins-to-premium-extension-sales/\">point out</a>, the search algorithm retrieves irrelevant results with more active installs than the plugin being searched for in many cases. It isn\'t possible to show all your plugins together anywhere on the repository apart from a buried profile tab under Contributor History. Even author searches do not retrieve every plugin from that source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt\'s  best point is that an average conversion rate is just that — an average. He\'s seen much better results due to marketing efforts he feels are accessible to many plugin vendors. Matt also points to examples of successful freemium plugin shops, like <strong>Paid Memberships Pro</strong> which recently did an A/B test with their pricing page. <strong>Jason Coleman</strong> reported <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jason_coleman/status/1582355558396743680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1582355558396743680%7Ctwgr%5E60ce4bbce4981ae7479f4aaa2a1b7b13c8467ff3%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mattcromwell.com%2Fthe-case-for-the-wordpress-plugin-freemium-model%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the version with a freemium option converted better</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://gutenberg.10up.com/\">Follow Leaders, Adopt Standards</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>10up</strong>&#8216;s <a href=\"https://gutenberg.10up.com/\">newly released resource site</a> for <strong>Gutenberg Best Practices</strong> is a signal WordPress has turned a corner. Here are expert tutorials, resources, references, and example code connected to 10up\'s <strong>GitHub </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/10up/gutenberg-best-practices/discussions\">discussion board</a> for this evolving community resource. It\'s intended to go beyond the official WordPress documentation, according <strong>Fabian Kaegy</strong>&#8216;s <a href=\"https://10up.com/blog/2022/10up-publicly-releases-its-gutenberg-best-practices/\">launch announcement</a>. It\'s a “more client-services-centric approach tailored to engineering enterprise-level editorial experiences.” Enterprise agency adoption of Gutenberg is huge. As we see a growing body of accumulated knowledge, standards, and best practices emerging, it signals and amplifies a wave of change.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-38 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h2>Quick Links</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Matt Cromwell</strong>, <strong>Natalie MacLees</strong>, <strong>Sybre Waaijer</strong>, and <strong>Amber Hinds</strong> have good ideas for future types of data disclosures that could help plugin owners.

Independently, we made nearly the same selections! It seems the temporary loss of active install stats at WP.org has created an opportunity to rethink long-held assumptions and find new ways forward. Our news picks are all related to this in one way or another.  So there\'s a single throughline in this episode — what works, what doesn\'t, and what will take WordPress businesses forward in the product, agency, and hosting spaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Are Active Install Counts Irrelevant to Your Plugin Business\'s Success? (Even if they were accurate?)</h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>There are always going to be developers who push the envelope when it comes to littering the dashboard and just making it a difficult user experience. Maybe data is part of the way we solve that.</p><cite><strong>Eric Karkovac</strong></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>First up is <strong>Alex Denning</strong>&#8216;s article at <strong>Ellipsis</strong>, &#8220;<a href=\"https://getellipsis.com/blog/org-is-ineffective-plugin-distribution/\">WordPress.org&nbsp;is ineffective for plugin distribution in 2022</a>.&#8221; Alex argues the likely temporary loss of Active Install Growth data for plugin owners is not a bottom-line, business-relevant concern. Apart from the revelation that that data itself was not just obfuscated and inexact but &#8220;<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/discussion-on-replacing-plugin-active-install-growth-data-continues-behind-closed-doors\">basically garbage</a>,&#8221; Alex draws on Ellipsis\' marketing experience and extensive data (as well as <strong>Iain Poulson</strong>&#8216;s <a href=\"https://s.wptrends.co/w/kWJrSn4PAY2Xziux1YiYEQ\">insights</a> at <strong>WP Trends</strong>) to show 1-2% conversion rates are the norm for plugins in the&nbsp;WP.org repository. Only a couple of big players can crack the 100k+ install tiers today. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Plugin Repo\'s Glass Ceiling</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex notes this &#8220;glass ceiling&#8221; has a lot to do with how the repo\'s search algorithm works. It\'s biased to favor plugins that have many active installs already, so if you\'re not there yet, it\'s not going to help you get there. As a result of these observations, Alex disrecommends the plugin repo for anyone thinking about launching a business there on the freemium model. He considers WP.org a poor distribution channel and assumes the freemium product model\'s fate is tied to it. On that point, we\'re doubtful and optimistic about exceptions and opportunities for plugin developers to make their own way, with or without the repo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Eric and I don\'t fully agree with Alex, his data-based analysis does establish that the plugin repository is &#8220;broken&#8221; if it\'s intended to be a place where a small entrepreneur with a good product can break in and take off. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Let\'s Fix What\'s Broken (The Plugin Repo) Not What Isn\'t (The Freemium Model)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Cromwell </strong>politely disagrees with Alex in a long, thoughtful post of his own:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mattcromwell.com/the-case-for-the-wordpress-plugin-freemium-model/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Case for the WordPress Plugin Freemium Model</a>.&nbsp;(There\'s a great <a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/C0413T6GD/p1666180505764299\">Post Status Slack thread</a> on it too.) In it, Matt describes ways plugin owners can make the&nbsp;wp.org&nbsp;plugin search engine work better for them, but he also notes a few of its deficiencies as well. His best point is that an average conversion rate is just that — an average. He\'s seen much better results due to marketing efforts he feels are accessible to many plugin vendors. Matt also points to examples of successful freemium plugin shops, like <strong>Paid Memberships Pro</strong> which recently did&nbsp;an A/B test&nbsp;with their pricing page, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jason_coleman/status/1582355558396743680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1582355558396743680%7Ctwgr%5E60ce4bbce4981ae7479f4aaa2a1b7b13c8467ff3%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mattcromwell.com%2Fthe-case-for-the-wordpress-plugin-freemium-model%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the version with a freemium option converted better</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where Alex and Matt agree is how much the plugin repo has changed due to market saturation. It isn\'t an easy place to win in anymore. And I\'m pretty sure Alex would agree with Matt this is true across the web as a whole — you can expect to have to work hard with stiff competition and give high attention to <strong>Google</strong> as well — not to mention all the other things that go into making and supporting a good product. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ideas for Improving the WordPress.org Plugin Repository</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric and I also discussed the excellent suggestions for useful, actionable data that product owners — and even agencies — would like from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://poststatus.com/five-takes-on-helpful-plugin-stats-and-insights/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a new, improved plugin directory</a>.&nbsp;<strong>Vito Peleg</strong>&#8216;s ideas are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VitoPeleg/status/1577784069596876800\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">especially exciting</a>&nbsp;and seemed to draw a nod from <strong>Matt Mullenweg</strong> on Twitter. We also note how better data for plugin owners might satisfy some needs that historically have led them to try all kinds of (often unpleasant) gimicks in the WordPress backend to connect with users and upsell or cross-market their products. In a comment at Post Status this week, <strong>Justin Labadie</strong> imagines <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/connect-freemium-plugins-to-premium-extension-sales/\">how this could work as part of the plugin install process</a>, along with other suggestions. Eric connected this line of thinking with <strong>Mark Zahra</strong>&#8216;s question in a recent post at <strong>WP Mayor</strong>, <a href=\"https://wpmayor.com/is-deceptive-marketing-ruining-wordpress-reputation/\">Is Deceptive Marketing Ruining WordPress’ Reputation?</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Plugin Developers Must Make Their Own Way</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric asked (and answered) a big question at the <strong>WP Minute</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thewpminute.com/what-should-plugin-developers-expect-from-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">What should plugin developers expect from WordPress</a>? You\'ve got to make your own way is a message I agree with, and I brought up my conversation with <strong>Till Krüss</strong> about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://poststatus.com/till-kruss-on-wordpress-performance-the-plugin-business-and-life/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Performance and the Plugin Business</a>&nbsp;as an example of all the possibilities that open up if you think about meeting big needs nobody else is meeting or solving big problems others are creating! </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Follow the Leaders, Adopt Standards</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Where we end up is <strong>10up</strong>&#8216;s <a href=\"https://gutenberg.10up.com/\">newly released resource site</a> for <strong>Gutenberg Best Practices</strong>. It\'s got tutorials, resources, references, example code — and they\'re encouraging use of <a href=\"https://github.com/10up/gutenberg-best-practices/discussions\">their GitHub discussion board for the site</a>. It\'s intended to go beyond the official WordPress documentation, according <strong>Fabian Kaegy</strong>&#8216;s <a href=\"https://10up.com/blog/2022/10up-publicly-releases-its-gutenberg-best-practices/\">launch announcement</a>. It\'s a “more client-services-centric approach tailored to engineering enterprise-level editorial experiences.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To me, that\'s a signal WordPress has turned a corner with Gutenberg. Top agency adoption of Gutenberg is huge, and as we see a growing body of accumulated knowledge, standards, and best practices emerging, it signals and amplifies a wave of change.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Building Products to Scale Opens Doors and Creates Opportunities for Growth</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Toward the end of the show I suggest that plugin developers (as well as agencies) targeting middle and low-end markets have tended to neglect standards around performance testing and security because their customers don\'t need to scale and because they can treat performance and security as a hosting problem. That\'s a barrier to accessing high-value enterprise clients, hosts, and agencies connected to both. It represents lost opportunities and money left on the table.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-42 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f517.png\" alt=\"🔗\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Also mentioned in the show:</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with <a href=\"https://gutenberg.10up.com/\">10up\'s Gutenberg resource hub</a>, several other future-facing WordPress sites sharing tools and knowledge catering to different audiences emerged in the last week or so:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://olliewp.com/\">Ollie</a> from <strong>Mike McAlister</strong> is shaping up to be &#8220;a blog where WordPress creators can get handy tips, tutorials, and tools for the WordPress block editor and full-site editing.&#8221; </li><li>A <a href=\"https://www.modernwpdev.co/\">Modern WP Dev Course</a> is being offered by <strong>Joey Farrugio</strong> and will cover end-to-end WordPress site builds for SaaS and Enterprise clients.

What\'s the top one on your mind?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> I think the conversation around the removal of the active install growth data is just continuing, isn\'t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, we\'re getting a lot of different points of view on it from developers, non-developers, and pretty much anyone else in the community who has an opinion on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Definitely. I\'ve been kind of pleased that it, you know, it settled down a bit and people are coming up with some pretty creative and constructive ideas of, um, well, just a lot of different perspectives on it. What did you think of Alex Denning\'s? He put out a newsletter last week, and I summarized some of that, and he put out a post. Um, now this week, um, that\'s not really surprising, but maybe a little sharply worded Stu um, kind of a bit of a, a shock to actually see it there that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. How did you, how do you feel about that? Take that, that the freemium model is not one his marketing agency would recommend necessarily as much as they did previously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Well, I mean, the good thing Alex did was he backed all that stuff up with numbers. I mean, he has charts. He\'s showing how hard it is right now for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New plugin to get into the [00:02:00] repository and, you know, break through with either, I think you mentioned a hundred k, a 500 k or a million active installs. Now you see like the numbers of that just going down, uh, throughout the years. And, you know, that\'s kind of the issue the plugin repository has right now is that you have, you know, just a few really large plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you have. You know, plenty of them are, you know, related to automatic in some way. Um, and those are the ones getting, you know, the most visibility, at least when you\'re first visiting the, uh, the repository. So I think, you know, Alex makes a lot of sense and, you know, just kind of gave us an honest take of what the challenges are if you\'re trying to go with that model these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Right. Yeah, it\'s, it\'s definitely gotten to be. A tougher, um, tough market to break into. And yet some of his, um, important numbers come from [00:03:00] Ian Paulson. Um, uh, WP Trends put out some of that stuff too, that, um, probably the mix of, of consolidation in the market and, and just it\'s own maturity. Yeah. It\'s hard to debut and, and crack quickly into, into the upper tears.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, I always look at, I always wonder what the exceptions are and there are some, and he did note, um, a few. And if, yeah, if you can bring other channels and other, other marketing, um, if you have a significant marketing empire or like, um, awesome motive, but even I think on a much smaller scale, it\'s, it\'s definitely gonna help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is this your only channel or, um, or, What did, um, what did you think of, of his take overall? You know, we have Matt Cromwell, um, kind of giving a, um, a counterpoint, [00:04:00] um, today. I saw that come out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Yeah, I mean, I, I think overall Alex makes a lot of good points. Um, you know, I\'m not a plug-in developer myself. I\'m not starting that business, but I could see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, if five to 10 years ago, if you were to dream about, okay, I\'m gonna create this plugin and it\'s going to kind of go viral within the community and people are going to pick up on it and use it, um, it, that\'s just not as realistic anymore. Um, you know, like I kind of referred to it on Twitter as like the wild west, um, you know, where anyone you could just, you know, start their own plot of virtual land and, you know, start selling and you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Break through that market. Now you are, as you said, you\'re up against these companies with large marketing budgets. Um, they, they\'re very skilled at getting the word out about their products. So if you were going to do this just through the repository [00:05:00] and, you know, as an individual or small agency, I\'m not sure, you know, you\'re gonna have a lot of success without just a major commitment and probably a little bit of luck and a great product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Right. Yeah. His, um, his headline, um, Alex is, is the.org repo is ineffective for plugin distribution. You know, kinda generalization as of this, this year or so. Um, I would say that\'s, he\'s really saying ineffective as maybe a single channel for, for distribution. A freemium model rooted just in.org is a, i I would say that\'s always been, you know, why limit yourself?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, why not, Why not cultivate other, other channels? And, um, we\'ve promoted partnerships a lot. A lot of people open up, um, other ways to get their, their plugin out by having hosting or agency partners that, um, make it easier. [00:06:00] Or required. It comes along with, with another product. Um, see Main WP is, um, packaged in with, at Tarm, which is packaged in with rocket.net.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s a, that was an interesting development there. Um, veto on, on Twitter was proposing a number of things that would be useful to get from data that, um, Matt Mullenweg, um, said, Hm, these are, you know, he gave some positive signals about that. Um, did you catch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> I did. Yeah. And I, I think something will come back eventually, um, you know, as to what that is and how long it\'ll take Will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. be interesting to see. But, you know, I, that kind of goes into, you know, what should they be providing to plugin developers and what should they, you know, what, what should anyone really expect about that? I\'m sure that\'s something we\'re gonna kinda get on in a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Right. Yes. Um, I\'ve seen a lot of reasonable opinion just come that the [00:07:00] more and more to, let\'s do what dr.org does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just release all the raw data. Don\'t interpret it on.org maybe, but leave that to however people choose to use it. And, and you could do an opt-in, opt out if you don\'t want your, your, um, your metrics in the mix. You can opt out or privatize, you know, only I get those. But the aggregate, uh, signal coming out of there is of high interest to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a lot of levels to a lot of people, including researchers. Um, and as, as Alex mentions, I\'ve said a lot, it\'s a data poor market and anyone who\'s curious in understanding it, uh, WordPress ecosystem, you want the, want the data, um, what you do with it, what you think it means is a whole, whole nother thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and I think it seems like there\'s an agreement too, kind of a consensus emerging that, um, Actually that growth, that growth number isn\'t [00:08:00] or hasn\'t been, um, terribly useful. So it\'s sort of irrelevant to, um, on a lot of levels Alex would say, because it\'s, it\'s not gonna help you, um, in this market anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but, um, you know, there\'s, there\'s other more useful things we could potentially get out of there. Um, yeah, so Matt\'s, Matt\'s take, I think the, for both of us, those are the two. This dialogue is um, kind of the top of mind thing here. Um, did you get a chance to break into, think through Matt\'s comments today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Yeah, so Matt Cromwell kind of gave a, a very respectful rebuttal to, uh, Alex Denning, um, which I like to see. Cuz you know, we can have those disagreements and you. And still talk about it rationally and, you know, uh, as community members and not as adversaries necessarily. So I think that that was the absolute right approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so, you know, Matt kind of went [00:09:00] into the plugin repository search algorithm and says that, you know, if, if you go in there and optimize your product with the right name or, um, tag your product under, you know, relevant, uh, terms, You can still be found in the search engine. Um, it\'s not necessarily, um, that you\'re gonna have the immediate visibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\'s go going on the repository and, you know, seeing like, um, the classic editor or Yost or something like that. But you\'re going to be able to be found if you, if you optimize. And he also said that, you know, in his experience with plugins and he\'s worked with a few of \'em, give WPS the one that comes to mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, You can actually convert a lot more, uh, freemium users into, uh, paying customers than the one to 2% that, uh, Alex Denning was uh, mentioning in his post. So, uh, I, I think that\'s, you know, so he, he\'s actually lived it a [00:10:00] bit and I think that\'s, um, mm-hmm. , you know, very relevant, I think kind of good news for other people that are trying to break into</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I\'ve always thought that if you\'re using that model or any model, you should be doing everything you can as soon as you have any kind of audience to get in relationship with your best users. You know, figure u usually you\'d have some kind of persona, you know, you, you know who your, your target audience is, and then maybe that revises over time as you, you get to actually know them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that\'s the best data you, you can get. Finding ways to develop that, um, that relationship is, um, is really key. There\'s then you, you kind of take control of your, you\'re not sitting back passively looking for a number to come in that might be dubious, um, is a big generalization. Um, can you get together a focus group or something like that?[00:11:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The, um, the thing that. I, I think, uh, resonated seems be resonated with a lot of people. With, with Matt\'s, is that that number you mentioned yet? Alex, Alex is speaking of, um, this, going through a lot of data. This is a general figure. This is the, the kind of conversion you can expect on a freemium plugin in, in the, um, what do you, uh, in the, in the.org repo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s, that\'s an average. So, An average for 50, 60,000 possible. Um, I suppose I\'m not, I\'m not sure what the restricted, um, data set is that they\'re looking at. Maybe it\'s a little more targeted than that, but, um, you may not be the average. Do you want to be the average? Do you want, do you wanna market yourself and, and consider your, your success based on relative to, to an average?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you wanna do 200 [00:12:00] times better than that? Um, and I, I would say, yeah, shoot for that is, is, is that kind of where you, you see Matt, um, saying, Look, there\'s, there\'s plenty of ways to be an exception to this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, one of the things he mentioned was, you know, it also depends on the category, the type of plugin you\'re in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. . If you\'re competing against the big SEO plugins or form plugins, for example, you\'re gonna have a hard time. There are a lot of established plugins out there that do these things and that have massive install numbers. Um, but if you have a great product that is in the right niche at the right time, there\'s no reason why you still can\'t have success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, yeah, I mean, one to 2% is kind of low. Um, but that doesn\'t mean your particular plugin is going to have to settle for that. I mean, Regardless of where you put your plug in. And I, I think, um, both [00:13:00] gentlemen agreed that, you know, dot org is a lot different than it was a few years ago, But regardless of where you put that effort, you still have to put in a lot of work in order to get good results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you know, Right. It, it\'s, you know, it ultimately it\'s up to the, to the developer, um, to market their product, to make a great product. And, you know, That, that\'s what\'s gonna lead to the results more than just, it\'s, it\'s home on the web basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Right? Yeah. There, it, it seems to me like there\'s a, there\'s an important perspective, um, shift that it\'s, it\'s worth, um, considering if there\'s kind of, there\'s a, there\'s a, you can look at at general.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall market numbers. You can try to look at how peers are doing within a certain trench there. And, and then there\'s the numbers you generate yourself and the, and it, it\'s somewhat, it [00:14:00] can be somewhat disempowering to, to get over occupied with, um, um, comparison to others. Um, just the whole psychology of that is that really doing well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, Or do you wanna define your own? I remember when, um, like some years ago, MailChimp or people in the newsletter marketing, um, world posted, here\'s industry averages on open rates and click rates, and I don\'t know where exactly how they computed this. Um, uh, I think the ones coming from MailChimp are based on their data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, Okay, this is probably reliable. And then, and then some years later, I\'ve, I\'ve seen totally. Figures, but um, in reference to that, like, wow, we\'re consistently two, three, even four times over that. So great . But is there really any actionable, um, data in that there, there\'s such broad, um, broad [00:15:00] figures. What, what, what do you think are the useful, um, practical things coming out of this, out of this conversation?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I see Matt has some things that they agree. It is tougher these days. Um, the market has changed a lot. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> yeah, I, I, I just think it\'s, it\'s a long overdue conversation. It\'s kind of funny that it took this particular incident to kind of spark it, but mm-hmm. , you know, as I said, if you\'re starting a, uh, a plug-in business today, it\'s so much different than it was a few years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, I, I think this could only benefit people in that position. Right now. They\'re, they\'re seeing both sides of the argument. They\'re seeing, you know, how they fit into, to what\'s happening out there in the WordPress community. So, you know, it, it\'s, it is very productive at the very least. And hopefully it leads to, you know, Some rethinking of the [00:16:00] statistics that really matter and that allow developers to make good</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right? Yeah. Um, I\'d, I\'d really like to, I\'m one of those who likes more data just to out of curiosity and analysis of, you know, understanding. The market as a whole, but when you\'re, when you\'re actually doing, making practical moves for your, your business, everyone\'s unique or different and, um, you know, or do you have a extension in the W commerce, uh, marketplace?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s a growth area. Uh, that\'s, is that, do you have all your eggs in one basket? Um, everything that Matt says at the end, that\'s a practical tip is like kind of a no brainer, but you get distracted from that. Pretty easily by looking over your shoulder at another side, I suppose identify your niche should keep it focused.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, launch day one with your free and paid options. Focus on user experience and excellent customer [00:17:00] support. I think those are, those are really key and are under, under practiced, um, across the, the board, um, user experience all the way to plays well with others. How, you know, whether you\'re bombarding people with notifications to, to upsell them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, there was, someone recently suggested a standard, um, a kind of industry, uh, standard way of doing that, that was part of the discussion. Um, maybe like the in line with WP Notify, What if we get to a consensus on, um, ways to reach. With freemium plugin plugins to, to the audience instead of all trying our own things inside the dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there anything else in that discussion or any other contributions to it that, um, you\'ve been reflecting on this week? Any anyone else writing in [00:18:00] on it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Yeah, I, I think you know, what you just mentioned about the notifications is interesting because we had, uh, You know, the post that Mark Zara, uh, had a couple of weeks ago about the marketing tactics, it kind of got me thinking about this data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, if you have accurate, actionable data, do you need to really go down the rabbit hole with some of these unsavory, I guess I\'ll call them marketing tactics, You know, if you had that access to the right data. You know, right now it\'s so open to experimentation because people may not exactly know what the right path is for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they\'re going to experiment. They\'re always going to be developers who push the envelope when it comes to, you know, littering the dashboard and, and just making it, uh, uh, a difficult user experience, I guess I should say. Um, [00:19:00] maybe data is part of the way we solve. Yeah. I,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I, I think that that\'s a good, a good tangent for this to, to go in tho Those two seem related to me as well because they\'re, they\'re two parts of that transaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, they\'re due to the not having. Telemetry and you\'ve gotta find some other way to reach out. And the easy, the low hanging fruit has seemed to be, well, let\'s put in a big, you must respond, you know, something where people are gonna click on it and, um, and respond. Um, but then there\'s all this pushback against that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other, other forms of marketing, like you\'ve, you\'ve mentioned, like Mark\'s mentioned, I should bring that up with him and see what his thoughts are since he\'s recently weighed in on both. And that that is ultimately though the user experience is where you get the, the pushback. Um, they want [00:20:00] someone using your plugin, um, may actually want to give you feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you find an appropriate channel? It\'s such a, it\'s such a one way transaction. Um, yeah, I don\'t, it seems like there should be some opportunities there and if there was collaboration, In the plugin industry to, hey, this is how we\'re all gonna do this. If there was a cluster of, of people or, or one particular company or, um, a group that agreed, let\'s try this particular way of, um, standardizing how we do this part of the interface, how we reach out to customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, I don\'t think we do anything as a community to set expectations at all or to educate people who are just casual users. And that cascades into them. Just, you know, never really entering more deeply into, into the WordPress project as maybe as much as they would. Um, [00:21:00] I wonder if there\'s lost opportunities there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, that\'s a good one. The notification thing I is a pet issue for me too. No one likes it. . No. No. Well, the other, the other thing I was gonna. Mention ties in into your, your other pick too. You, you wrote a piece on what developers should expect from, um, from WordPress and, Yeah. What, Let me walk us through your, your main points there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Yeah. So, you know, with, with all the, the talk about the data being removed, that also kind of got me thinking of, well, you know, what is it that if I\'m a plugin developer, what should I expect from the WordPress project? You know? And my conclusion is that I don\'t know that the WordPress project is necessarily interested in helping you make money off of your plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know? Mm-hmm. , they\'re providing us with a [00:22:00] platform. That we can build on. So there\'s the opportunity to make money, and they\'re offering us, you know, documentation and, you know, different events and things like that to help us learn, um, how we can use the platform for, for our needs. However, you know, when it gets to the point of, you know, are, are they in the market to help any big plugin developer make.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, should they be, Is that something that. You know, we should reasonably expect them to care about, um, you know, like personally, I felt like the data that was there, they should have done a, a much better job in explaining why it was removed. Because I think that is the part of it that gets people fired up the most perhaps, is that there\'s just no explanation for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s no official word. You know, there\'s a, a rumor here and there. In, when you look at it [00:23:00] in, in a, uh, broader view, is that data something that WordPress owes to plug in developers necessarily? Right. So that was kind of my point as to, you know, Yes, we\'ve missed this data and it could be useful, but we also have to realize that every one of these plug-in developers is a third party entity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of them are commercial, including automatic, and so. , you know, are we going to expect WordPress to facilitate our money making? You know, that\'s ultimately up to the company. That\'s up to the developer, right? Um, they\'re giving us the tool to build upon and you know, we take it from there. And that\'s right kind of where it ends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Exactly. Um, yeah, it\'s a bit of a humbling message, but I, I think it\'s, it\'s an over overdue one. And, and maybe that\'s actually a good, explicit conversation to [00:24:00] have. What, what should, what should the project set as expectations? Um, can those be explicitly laid out, um, to people who are in the extender category of, you know, building plugins and themes and services?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you, you often, You know, Des describing. The very large realm of third party, um, businesses built around WordPress, um, describing them as, as super fans, um, is, is an interesting thing. I I, I kind of had a chuckle out of, because I, I think there\'s another side of that perspective where it\'s like, you know, with friends like these, you , like this is the, the people who.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, con, you know, everyone, everyone who\'s had some success or prominence in, in the market, there\'s a, there\'s a strong tendency towards maybe conveying, you know, especially if you\'re Twitter, active personality, God\'s gift to, uh, [00:25:00] to WordPress and expanding the market here and well from, um, from other, other perspectives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to other projects, testing performance is, uh, something that a lot of third party, uh, products have delegated upward to hosts to deal with. Um, it\'s not just WordPress core, although that\'s there, but, um, the tightening focusing in on performance now, I, I think is really important. But it\'s something that, um, you know, unlike other projects, Testing is not as, um, aggressively implemented or standardized, um, across the board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can get stuff in the, in the repo without, you know, necessarily doing, you know, end to end deep testing of, um, for security and performance. And I think any, anything, any developments on [00:26:00] that front are, are to be encouraged. There\'s. That\'s ongoing. But, um, if, if plugin developers really took charge of that, um, that\'s an area that there\'s clear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clear synergy and, uh, alignment of interest with e everybody. And I think that\'s where everyone benefits. Um, you, you may not be owed anything, but um, for your, for your, your contributions, but everyone benefits when, when those are good, when, uh, when everyone\'s kind of aligned and, and, uh, performance and, and security are, are ones where just absolutely everyone is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In, in it together? No, no one, um, everyone has an interest in, in everything performing as well as possible and being as secure as possible. So that, that kind of touches the, um, the other thing I wanted to bring up, which is one of our own, um, back in August, [00:27:00] I, uh, recorded a, a conversation with Tell Chris, um, who\'s Object Cash Pro and is working on a success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Product, Um, and has had huge success with a high value hosting market. Partnerships with, with that, he has a freemium plugin that is also super valuable. That is originally from a forked product of, um, I think some core, core developers quite some time back about a decade, um, that they, they established and then left and, and till took over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, with his own, his own versions, he has over a hundred thousand. Installs tracked on the on the.org repo with that. But his premium product, which actually is not open source to protect, to protect it as intellectual property, um, that is where you get the big, the bigger revenue from fewer clients [00:28:00] because it appeals to hosts who have such, or anyone who has such a high volume of traffic paying you a thousand bucks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, a month. Is saving me 20 20,000 on the bandwidth that, so it, it\'s kind of, um, it\'s a, it\'s a really fascinating model that I think doesn\'t translate to everybody. It\'s a niche product, but there are lessons from it that really do, and it\'s how can I build something that\'s so tested rigorously and so performant that I don\'t have more than like five minutes of support time a day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All plugin developers complain, , plugin, plugin businesses are complain about support. So amazing relationship there with kind of sell itself and, and two, this is coming from someone who is self taught, I believe, largely self taught developer who then spent time outside of WordPress in Lve and got deeply into performance and, and testing and brings a [00:29:00] rigor from that project back to WordPress, which is sad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not common and not part of the culture and not intensely supported and taught. Um, so I, I think those are things plugin developers can look to and, and learn from. I don\'t know if you had a chance to listen to that. I, I actually did more writing about, about that conversation the more I thought about it than I usually do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Yeah. Hi. His story is very interesting and I said going to the hosting market. Is really unique. No, I mean, how many WordPress plugins are really doing that? And I think what he shows is that there are still opportunities. If you have something that is very niche that you don\'t have to necessarily even worry about the plugin repo so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. And it\'s partly an opportunity that\'s been, it\'s very stereotypical. It goes back a long way. It\'s an [00:30:00] structural feature of, of WordPress culture and, and software engineering. Um, he\'s solving a problem that exists because WordPress. Is is not super competitive on the performance front. More and more, that\'s more and more an issue at time, uh, over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it\'s being more aggressively dealt with now. Uh, but a large part of that, I remember 10, 15 years ago, you know, hosts, it was like a glass half full glass, half empty. Everyone\'s installing WordPress and 250 plugins, and some of them are nuts, . And it\'s like it brings it to a crawl. Um, so there\'s been this huge boom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Managed WordPress hosting and really to cater with that to, to that. Um, and I think, and it\'s not just that all P h p MyQ, um, CMS platforms that got popular around the same time, you, you can, you [00:31:00] know, left to your own devices someone can install and quite a lot of stuff on there and. That\'s never, performance, hasn\'t been pushed to as a core competency and responsibility of third party developers in, in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that\'s really overdue and is hugely in their interest and until has a, a winning product because it matters so much at scale. Um, and that\'s another, that\'s another thing if your plugin doesn\'t. Doesn\'t, wasn\'t conceived of and architected towards, towards scale. Well you, are you going to be able to market this, um, in a higher tier?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is this something that a V I P agency is gonna do code review and say, you know, we like this future set, but, um, you know, uh, uh, this is gonna, here are, here are issues with security, [00:32:00] performance and so on. I think that sort of. That sort of barrier is there and maybe not talked about as much as, as it should.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s a lot of learning, um, that could happen there that\'s constructive. Um, if you\'re going for a middle or low market, maybe you don\'t think about that as much, but there\'s a lot of high dollar value in having, having something that is going to be adopted by high value market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Yeah. I mean, if you make yourself indispensable to, uh, Larger installs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think you could find yourself, uh, doing pretty well in this space. But, you know, talking about performance, I mean, there\'s really not a lot of formal educational opportunities out there right now for that. Um, you know, and the kind of the. Blessing and curse of programming is that you can build things more than one way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, if you ask me to build you a form, I can build you a form in many different ways. [00:33:00] Doesn\'t necessarily mean it\'s gonna be the most performant. Um, and you know, if there\'s no real standard or there\'s nobody sitting there and, you know, testing all of these things, um, before they get into repository.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\'re, you could be stuck with something that you know isn\'t very performant and, you know, the average site owner\'s not going to know that there are faster, better alternatives. So that\'s kind of the, the, uh, the challenge we find ourselves in right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, I\'ve, I\'ve said before, somewhat, you know, half serious, you know, that I would love to see statistics on, you know, what\'s the average amount of, of queries, queries that this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugin will add to my site if I install it. And is it arbitrarily loading dependencies and, and adding, adding page weight on, um, absolutely every page load? Or is it just doing that where it needs to? There there are [00:34:00] things like that that, um, I think public attention to would, would have a, be. Impact. Um, it just hasn\'t, hasn\'t really been considered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have a third, uh, third item or, or was the Alex and, and Matt, the kind of counting his too. Did, Is there one more? Um, Pick of the week for</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> you? Well, I, I, I think, uh, I was really interested in, in looking at, uh, 10 UPS Gutenberg best practices site, cuz that kind of ties into this a little bit with the education.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\'s a very big agency, does a lot of, um, large WordPress based projects and they\'re kind of sharing their methods for building Gutenberg blocks, for working with block themes and the theme json file. Um, and you know, maybe that\'s one of our solutions community. Mm-hmm. members that have had success and have a reputation for quality sharing, how they do things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know web dev [00:35:00] studios has done similar things in the past where if you can kind of see how they do things, maybe that rubs off on other developers and they also, you know, build things to be performant and sustainable. Um, you know, that\'s the kind of information I think is, is really just crucial to have cuz it goes beyond just the basic documentation that WordPress</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> provides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, absolutely. I, I\'ve, um, I was pleased to see that come out. I\'ve kind of been looking for that for years. I was like, you know, knowing that\'s kind of a bellwether, you know, we\'ll have turned a corner when, when you see the, um, top agencies, uh, turning. Um, case studies, documentation, tutorials, explainers that are, are really useful and, and helpful, but are also signaling, hey, they\'ve, they\'ve turned the corner on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are, they\'re doing Gutenberg first, um, with, with new, new site builds. Um, [00:36:00] and I, I think I, I\'ve never seen anyone mention this, but. I, I feel that there\'s a, um, there\'s a need there. Maybe there isn\'t enough of a hunger for, for unofficial standards. Uh, when, when back, way back when managed hosting, um, started to come out and, um, I remember WP Engine was, I think the, the first I recall where there was a public list of do of plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\'t allow or, Yeah. Um, and I was like, Cool. That saves me a lot of time, . And I, I kept up with that and I kind of, I aligned my own lists with that and, and tried to learn, Okay, why is that? And to kind of sharpen my own understanding of. How experts are, are picking and screening and you know, you look at, um, WordPress v i p documentation, I, I\'ve done that from time time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, what is their [00:37:00] perspective on, on ACF or, um, or, or something else that, uh, I, I don\'t, I don\'t know that that\'s done at. People who are serving a kind of lower middle market and who can count on, let\'s just, we\'ll just throw more server horsepower on that, that will be the client\'s problem. Um, there are, there are leaders who build the topnotch, you know, flagship sites out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, everyone always mentions White house.org, which used to be, which was a big brag for Duple back in the day. That was, it was originally a droople site. And if we\'re going to recognize leadership and leaders like that, then I think what comes along with that is, is taking the best practices at standards seriously, and hopefully seeing more of those come out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there was a 10 up one, and then I also noticed really all at the same time. So Mike McAllister has, um, Launched Ollie, [00:38:00] um, WordPress tutorials and tools that are really focused on the future of the block editor and full site editing. Um, and there were a couple of others that, um, that popped out. Do you know Alex, the WP Marmite?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I don\'t really, I don\'t know them that well,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> but, uh, that one I, no, I, I, I don\'t know Alex very well. Um, I\'ve heard, I\'ve heard of WP Marmite, but I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I\'ve looked over there a few times. I noticed I, it is like, wow, this is a trend in the, in the last seven to 10 days. Um, new tutorial sites being launched that he has one on per, I think it\'s a performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, have to look back up, up in here. W p Turbo. Um, yeah, which has got, uh, code generators, short code generators, um, familiar things from the past, but, um, gear. Um, reminds me to generate wp, um, or what was that site called? Um, I think that was [00:39:00] it. It, this, yeah, where you can, but it\'s, it\'s got a tutorial component too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, uh, kind of updating those things for, um, performance and the future of. Of the word press editor, um, Jamie Marclin put out a nice, uh, video on how to build quality page layouts in just 10 minutes. right is his, uh, sales line there, which is, which actually there, it, it\'s not easy to make things look good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, you need layout, You need to learn some layout, design, skill, basics. Make hash in, um, any kind of , any kind of page builder. And I think people turning to focus on those, um, on those things is a really good sign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Yeah. I mean, when you think about it, it\'s, you know, we have great tools and some, some tools don\'t require us to write code, but you still have to have some fundamental skills in place mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>before you can [00:40:00] really have success with them. And I think you know it, I mean, Elementor is a great product, but it doesn\'t necessarily make you a designer by trade. No. Um, just from installing it, I mean, there, there, there\'s, you still have to put in a little bit of work. So these kind of sites are, are nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To have because you, those references, you know, can help you become better at what you\'re doing. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. And, um, on that note, um, the WordPress, WordPress 6.1 is looking like a really, you\'re gonna be a really cool release. And I noted that. Um, yeah. WordPress, v i p put out a, what they called hot takes, um, on, um, On the value of, of what\'s, what\'s in, um, what\'s in 6.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That should be noted by, um, their, their audience, their clientele. So I\'m, I\'m, I\'m interested in, in that often, like, you\'re, Okay, so this is directed towards, towards their [00:41:00] clients. This is, you know, very different than the, the, you know, the, um, The broad, mid middle market. Um, and they\'re, they\'re focusing on things like constraints, you know, that you can lock lock blocks, um, which is huge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, you know, you only, I, I\'ve only heard agency people and, and freelancers, anyone dealing with clients talking about, Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You\'ve got reusable block. You know, we\'ve all found ways probably to new car work by. With reusable blocks that aren\'t, aren\'t locked down or, um, uh, even see Brian Cords mentioned something I\'ve, I\'ve done a few times, although I, I had revisions turned on so I could, I could go back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it\'s, um, it\'s quite easy to have a second tab open and forget you\'ve made changes in this other tab and then, you know, wipe them out or, or something like that. There\'s a lot, there\'s a lot of little ways. So many more [00:42:00] options in, in Gutenberg can, um, frustrate people whose time, you know, that are, you don\'t want your clients foundering in, in these kinds of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so that, that to me is a good sign too, that we\'re, we\'re looking at constraints as, as a positive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Yeah, I mean in the old days we went to great lengths to, to lock things away from clients and now Gutenberg kind of takes that away, when it came out it\'s like, okay, well now they have access to everything and they can do freak all sorts of havocs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the ability to lock things down is, you know, is, is key for the future, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Anything else we should throw on the, on the, on the deck or,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> I think that was about it. Busy week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> No, it seems not. Not, not. No one got acquired. No major, huge business things, but, um, and still trying to digest the [00:43:00] implications of all, all the new, uh, w w commerce, hosted w commerce platforms that are, are rolling out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, that\'s, that\'s a big deal. Uh, but yeah, another time another conversation all. Well, thanks for, uh, thanks for joining me again, and we can, uh, do a few more roundups like this, uh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> now and then. Thank you for having me.

The previews now appear on block themes that include style variations. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Themes that have more variations than what fits in the space beneath the preview pane will display all variations in a carousel with little arrows to navigate to the next ones. Here&#8217;s an example with the Pixl theme from Automattic that contains seven brightly colored variations:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also possible to see a selected style variation loaded into the theme preview now. Clicking the &#8216;Preview&#8217; button will allow users to scroll and explore the theme with their selected style variation applied.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;These style variations, designed by theme authors and packaged in block themes, help users have a diverse set of approaches to their site design allowing them to find one that aligns with their goals,&#8221; Automattic-sponsored Meta team contributor Steve Dufresne said. &#8220;This feature helps to highlight the flexibility of modern WordPress themes and it’s time to have it baked into the theme directory experience.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new style variation previews are fetched from the themes&#8217; <code>/styles/{variation_name}.json</code> files, so theme authors do not have to do anything to make the previews work. They will automatically display for any theme that includes style variations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meta team contributors are also working on adding the ability to filter the directory for themes with style variations. Dufresne proposed creating a new <code>style-variations</code> theme tag as the simplest route towards implementing this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Doing so will allow the active filtering of these themes without needing to make many if any code changes,&#8221; he said in the <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6545\">ticket</a>&#8216;s description.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;A longer-term solution should look at exposing these features visibly somehow without needing to find the obscured filters that we currently have. This feature should be judged equally with others and therefore, this type of implementation should be better debated and falls out of the scope of this ticket and the immediate need to see themes with style variations.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a good observation, as not all WordPress users hunting for themes will know that a tag exists in the Feature Filter. That list is already quite lengthy and not the best user experience for discovering themes with specific features, especially if users don&#8217;t understand what the terms mean.  Theme authors will want to watch this <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6545\">ticket</a>. If the shorter term solution of creating a new <code>style-variations</code> tag is committed, they will need to update their themes with the tag to be included in the filtering.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 15:31:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"Post Status: Connect freemium plugins to premium extension sales?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=141363\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"https://poststatus.com/connect-freemium-plugins-to-premium-extension-sales/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4531:\"<div class=\"wp-container-55 wp-block-group eplus-wrapper has-theme-palette-2-color has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><div class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">Justin Labadie\'s wishlist for the WordPress.org plugin repo: <br /><br />1) Ensure all search results are relevant. <br />2) Standardize a Premium product upsell interface. <br />3) Make it possible to show other products by the same author.  </p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer eplus-wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"yoast-reading-time__wrapper\"><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__icon\"></span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__spacer\"></span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__descriptive-text\">Estimated reading time:  </span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__reading-time\">3</span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__time-unit\"> minutes</span></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\"><strong>Justin Labadie</strong> from <a href=\"http://slickremix.com/\">SlickRemix</a> left <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/two-key-questions-we-need-to-answer/#comment-492939\">a helpful comment</a> that adds an interesting idea to the mix of possible futures for the wordpress.org plugin repository. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Search results should show peer products, not totally unrelated ones</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Confirming <a href=\"https://www.mattcromwell.com/the-case-for-the-wordpress-plugin-freemium-model/\">some problems</a> <strong>Matt Cromwell</strong> has noted about the repository\'s search algorithm, Justin describes how he and his brother <strong>Spencer Labadie</strong> had a plugin there that was &#8220;stacked in the search [results]&#8221; with unrelated plugins showing much higher active installs. Nothing the Labadies tried changed this outcome, so &#8220;After many hours, a few years, and &#8230; little to no growth no matter the hours or money&#8221; they decided to get out of the repo. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-standardize-what-works-for-freemium-premium-plugins-upsells-in-the-back-end\">Standardize what works for freemium/premium plugins: Upsells in the back end</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, Justin says &#8220;almost every free install was a premium extension sale of some kind,&#8221; so they were definitely getting value from the plugin repository and freemium model but on the strength of their own product and sales funnel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With our main plugin we have ways we hook people into purchasing our premium extensions,&#8221; Justin commented. He says there should be &#8220;a standardized way for free plugins to do this.&#8221; Why not standardize what works well?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How it could look:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I imagine a hook [where] users installing plugins see extensions offered by the plugins/themes. If we standardize something clean and not overly spammy-looking where devs can hook into that [and] show users what they offer that is premium&#8230;. Not a “Premium plugins store” but simply a page or way to display offerings within the repo that users can choose to click see that would take them to place to purchase. There would also be a similar and standardized way of hooking into displaying [upsells] on the [end user\'s] WordPress install’s backend.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, some kind of &#8220;Here\'s what else we offer&#8221; page or panel would come up during the installation process on each site.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Make it easy to find everything contributed by each author or company</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<img width=\"752\" height=\"419\" src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-21-at-7.42.57-AM-752x419.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"not-transparent wp-image-141397\" />This is the only place in the plugin repository where you might (possibly) find all the plugins by a single author/vendor.</div>\n\n\n<p>Currently, it\'s not easy or even truly possible to display all the plugins by a single author in the repo. If they are the only author, or if their account is connected to all their plugins in the repo (and many aren\'t), it is only possible to see all those plugins together on the authors\' own profile pages under their Contribution History\'s &#8220;Plugins&#8221; tab. Company/owner pages that list all contributors and all company products — including themes — would do the most to help WordPress businesses using the repository.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 13:58:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"WPTavern: WordPress Documentation Team to Host Its First Online Contributor Day, October 25, 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=138800\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:106:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-documentation-team-to-host-its-first-online-contributor-day-october-25-2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2185:\"<p>WordPress&#8217; Documentation Team will be <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/docs/2022/10/19/the-first-ever-documentation-team-contributor-day-25th-october-2022/\">hosting an online Contributor Day</a> on October 25, 2022, ahead of WordPress&#8217; anticipated 6.1 release the following week. Milana Cap, who has been volunteering with the Documentation team for years and is currently sponsored by XWP, announced the event this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The primary goal is to catch up with a lot of tasks in the team’s backlog but also it&#8217;s an opportunity for all contributors to meet, collaborate in real time, and help onboard all new contributors who need any kind of help,&#8221; Cap said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The virtual event will be the first of its kind for the Documentation team but follows in the footsteps of other contributors teams, including the Polyglots and Accessibility teams, which have hosted wildly successful global events that include contribution and onboarding. These types of virtual gatherings help contributors get connected and put names to faces</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New contributors are encouraged to attend, even if it&#8217;s just for a short time to see what documentation contribution is all about. Cap requested everyone who plans to attend to leave their names on the GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/Documentation-Issue-Tracker/issues/527\">issue</a> dedicated to the Contributor Day. It outlines the steps to begin contributing and highlights a list of tickets awaiting content review for older documentation as well as more recent block editor and end user documentation tickets. For example, there is a project board specifically for <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/WordPress/projects/45/views/11\">high priority tickets remaining for 6.1</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Documentation team will be kicking off the event on <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20221025T1000\">Tuesday, October 25, 2022 at 06:00 AM EDT</a> and it will run for 10 hours.

As a large and growing company well positioned in Pune, <a href=\"https://yourstory.com/2020/01/pune-tech-startup-hub-maharashtra-state-innovation-policy/amp\">India\'s tech hub</a>, rtCamp recruits new university graduates but in the spirit of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp\"><strong>BarCamp</strong></a> and the idea of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_Table_(disambiguation)\">round table</a> (where the &#8220;rt&#8221; comes from), rtLearn mints WordPress professionals from college students, new recruits, &#8220;dropouts, freshers, or people with some work experience.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year ago, rtCamp CEO and Founder <strong><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/member-spotlight-rahul-bansal/\">Rahul Bansal</a></strong> wrote that all their new hires had &#8220;gone through remote training via our rtLearn platform,&#8221; and in two years &#8220;these remote classrooms &#8230; allowed us to blow past the <a href=\"https://rtcamp.com/blog/100-rtcampers/\">100-employee mark</a>.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year later, and rtCamp\'s headcount has about doubled on their path to being fully distributed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rtCamp on-site campus program is a full-time, paid, six-month training course rtCamp draws some employees from. They also have a free, <strong>CC0</strong> master <a href=\"https://learn.rtcamp.com/courses/wordpress-development/\">WordPress Development course</a> anyone can take online. This is an outstanding model for WordPress workforce development, and it would be terrific if other major agencies in the space borrowed from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Compare Plugins Side by Side</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, I\'ve been watching rtCamp\'s <strong><a href=\"https://wpplugincompare.com/\">WordPress Plugin Compare</a></strong> directory evolve as a really helpful site for comparing plugins side-by-side. They keep adding <a href=\"https://rtcamp.com/blog/wppc-feature-update-filter/\">more features</a> to assist in comparative analysis. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sharing Expertise: Personalization </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently published on the rtCamp blog — an unfolding <a href=\"https://rtcamp.com/blog/personalization-web-intro/\">series on Personalization</a> geared toward the enterprise. In an upcoming post, they\'ll have a case study involving a WordPress — Salesforce Marketing Cloud integration with user segmentation functionality that empowers marketing teams to create email campaigns connected to personalized landing pages on the WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If case studies, tools, and explainers are your thing, the rtCamp blog is full of treats:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://rtcamp.com/blog/visual-automation-framework-migration-projects/\">A Visual Automation framework for pixel perfect migration and re-platforming</a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/rtCamp/visual-automation-backstop\">GitHub</a>)</li><li><a href=\"https://rtcamp.com/case-studies/migrating-vinsolutions-kentico-cms-to-wordpress-vip/\">Migrating VinSolutions.com from Kentico CMS to WordPress VIP</a> — a client migration case study where Vinsolutions.com is brought from Kentico CMS to a WordPress VIP multisite environment — while increasing the overall website Core Web Vitals performance by 48%.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Elementary: A Block-based Starter Theme</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Available on Github, rtCamp has shared a starter theme for block-based, full-site editing themes with developer-friendly features: <a href=\"https://github.com/rtcamp/theme-elementary\">Elementary</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s solid boilerplate following WordPress coding standards that\'s fully FSE-ready with a baked-in testing framework.</p>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 20:08:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"Post Status: A Makeover for HelpHub — and you can help the Docs Team on Contributor Day\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=137716\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"https://poststatus.com/a-makeover-for-helphub-and-you-can-help-the-docs-team-on-contributor-day/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:764:\"<p>Pretty <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/docs/2022/10/19/new-design-for-helphub-in-wordpress-org/\">snazzy new looks</a> coming the the WordPress documentation site!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/docs/2022/10/19/new-design-for-helphub-in-wordpress-org/\">New design for HelpHub in WordPress.org</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can help the Docs Team!

The commit cited &#8220;insufficient data obfuscation&#8221; but there was no clear communication about when and where this decision had been made. Developers <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-plugin-developers-demand-transparency-regarding-the-removal-of-active-install-growth-data\">demanded more transparency</a> around the charts&#8217; removal but received no clear answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multiple opportunities to communicate the details behind the decision were deliberately forgone, as speculation mounted. Several contributors not directly involved in the conversations prematurely insisted it was removed due to a security or privacy concern, but Samuel Otto Wood has unequivocally confirmed that it was neither of these things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a recent appearance on the <a href=\"https://wpwatercooler.com/wpwatercooler/ep432-solutions-to-the-active-growth-problem/\">WPwatercooler podcast</a>, Wood elaborated on the decision, which he says was made in May through private channels via Slack DMs in a discussion initiated by Matt Mullenweg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The reason is really quite simple,&#8221; Wood said. &#8220;It was removed because by and large, nobody was using them. Nobody was using the chart itself.  By and large, the chart was not useful to the majority, and it didn’t really fit the purpose we had for it, that we had in mind when we implemented it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wood said the active growth chart was intended to just show growth or decline of a plugin on a weekly basis, but the data wasn&#8217;t working as intended:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>People wanted that feedback on whether plugin’s growing, whether it’s shrinking, et cetera. And that’s valuable information for developers to have,  it’s valuable information users to know. But it really wasn’t working as that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The data that it provided was a percentage based data, and it was a very weak percentage based data. So by and large, the majority of use of that data was people scraping the data and using it to work backwards to the exact quote, exact numbers</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was entirely the problem was that people were largely using it to get those numbers. Now, that’s not itself bad, but a, the reverse math didn’t work. It was wrong for a number of reasons, mainly because we were doing such a way obfuscating the data in such a way that it made that number wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, Actually, it’s kind of funny. It actually always gave numbers a bit too high, so it was giving people the wrong impression. Third, it really, people trusted it as an active number, as a number of active cells to the point where, to the point where they, they relied on it to make decisions and things like that. It was not a good idea.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Otto was not involved in working on the project at the time, he was privy to the discussion and relayed some of the details:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I read through all that discussion and we worked, they worked on it for a long, Scott and several people tried various things before removing it. They adjusted the values, they adjusted numbers. They, they went through a ridiculous amount of iteration and in the end, none of it worked. People were still using it even though it was giving them basically garbage. So finally removing it was the only thing to do. We did have a plan for replacing it. We just didn’t have a plan for replacing it immediately. Nevertheless, giving them active install count numbers that are wrong is more harmful, we felt, to both users and developers interests than simply not giving them at all. So that’s why it was removed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The concern podcast host Sé Reed and guest Matt Cromwell highlighted was that the decision was communicated in such a way that it suggested it was security related. Since it was not a sensitive security or privacy issue, Reed asked why was it handled in a private chat instead of the meta channel when the decision had such a profound impact on developers being able to track the trajectory of their plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the inaccuracy of the charts was well-known to those more intimately acquainted with the problem, Wood said its removal was &#8220;not quite the big deal&#8221; that everyone else ended up perceiving it to be. They did not anticipate the firestorm the charts&#8217; removal would create in the <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511\">trac ticket</a> where developers were pleading to have them restored.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The physical visual chart itself is not so instrumental to the way I operate things,&#8221; GiveWP founder Matt Cromwell said. &#8220;But it’s the act of removing it without any conversation whatsoever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And what does that mean for the long run of data about plugins on.org and the viability of their, of us, continuing to have them? That’s the real question. It’s an indicator of an underlying problem that isn’t getting better.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This incident has sparked discussions about <a href=\"https://thewpminute.com/what-should-plugin-developers-expect-from-wordpress/\">what kind of partnership plugin developers should expect from WordPress.org</a>, and whether it&#8217;s time they looked for support from one another instead of the platform, as Eric Karkovack suggested on The WP Minute. In light of plugin developers losing more valuable data that hasn&#8217;t been replaced, Alex Denning, managing director of Ellipsis, a digital marketing agency, makes the case that <a href=\"https://getellipsis.com/blog/org-is-ineffective-plugin-distribution/\">WordPress.org is ineffective for plugin distribution in 2022</a>. He contends that new WordPress plugins are not passing the 100k, 500k , or 1m+ install thresholds and the directory isn’t giving plugins organic reach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The focus of the ticket has changed from calling on WordPress.org to bring back the active growth charts to be more about brainstorming helpful plugin stats and insights that plugin developers would like to see. It is still receiving angry and frustrated comments from developers who believe the data should belong to the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I cannot emphasize enough that conversations about what to replace the active growth chart with should be happening in a public Slack channel or on a Trac ticket,&#8221; Equalize Digital CEO Amber Hinds said. &#8220;This data should belong to the community and the community should be able to participate in deciding how (or not) to display it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reasons that purportedly necessitate obfuscation have not been clearly explained, but many participants in the discussion have urged WordPress.org to simply publish the raw data so it can be accessed and processed independently of the platform. @Starbuck <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511#comment:108\">suggests</a> the community would then be able to create sites that render the data in meaningful and interesting ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress developers want far more data than was previously available. Hinds <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511#comment:105\">requested</a> an assortment of data points that may or may not be possible:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Things that tell us if our readme and other ranking factors are on track:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Number of searches (or impressions) for target keywords</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Average ranking for target keywords for timeframe (month)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Conversion rates from impression to install for target keywords</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Things that tell us if we may have a problem with our plugin:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Number of deactivations per timeframe (month, preferably week)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Number of deletions per timeframe (month, preferably week)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Average time from activation to deactivation or deletion</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Things for better testing of releases:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Top 20 plugins also active</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Top 20 themes also active</li>\n\n\n\n<li>PHP versions (percentage)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordPress versions (percentage)</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Atarim CEO Vito Peleg <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VitoPeleg/status/1577784069596876800\">suggested</a> some other tools for monitoring growth/decline, to which Matt Mullenweg responded that some of the ideas were &#8220;very doable:&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Time to churn (to deactivate) signals good/bad onboarding, UI/UX</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Repeat installs &#8211; how many users (anonymized) install on multiple sites for community opp &amp; advocacy</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Time to result: dev can choose 1 single hook to trigger as “result” and the calculation checks how long from install to get there. By changing the placement of the hook devs can optimize entire flows.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Inner page tracker: which/how many inner plugin pages users visit</li>\n\n\n\n<li>PHP ver distribution, general country-based installs, active install to review ratio</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Wood confirmed that the active install growth charts are not coming back in their previous form and that the endpoint people were scraping before will remain disabled. He said those involved in the private discussion are monitoring the Trac ticket for feedback.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What’s going to happen is, that the active install count instead of being rounded to the nearest digit is going to be changed,&#8221; Wood said. &#8220;I don’t know the exact break points cutoffs, but as an example show individual up to 50, then round to nearest 10 until thousand and nearest hundred until 10,000, for example. So that we are making the active install count much more fine grained than it has been. So in that sense, yes, we’re giving you the data. It’s not going to be exact numbers, but it’s going be much better than it was before. We’re still working on doing that.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 04:38:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"Post Status: November: Register to speak at WordFest Live — and come to WordPress Accessibility Day\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=137720\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://poststatus.com/register-to-speak-at-wordfest-live/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:840:\"<ul><li>Coming up on <strong>November 18</strong>, <strong>WordFest Live</strong> will once again <em>“support and promote positive well-being and mental health within remote working communities.”</em> <a href=\"https://www.wordfest.live/2022/november/\">REGISTER →</a></li><li>And don\'t forget <strong>WordPress Accessibility Day</strong> on <strong>November 2-3</strong>! <strong><a href=\"https://wpaccessibility.day/\">REGISTER →</a></strong></li><li>Then on <strong>November 21</strong>, it\'s <strong>Alicia St. Rose</strong> of <strong>WP With Heart </strong>giving a <strong>Meetup</strong> talk on <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/wordpress-accessibility-meetup-group/events/287994860/\">Being an A11y with Your Content</a>.</li></ul>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 03:37:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: #47 – Adam Silverstein on the State of Images in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://wptavern.com/?post_type=podcast&p=138682\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/47-adam-silverstein-on-the-state-of-images-in-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57784:\"Transcript<div>\n<p>[00:00:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Welcome to the Jukebox podcast from WP Tavern. My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, the state of images in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea featured on the show. Head over to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox and use the contact form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Adam Silverstein. Adam is a WordPress core comitter, where he works to fix bugs and improve modern web capabilities. As a developer relations engineer in the content ecosystem team at Google, he works to invigorate the open web by empowering and educating developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the recent WordCamp US he gave a presentation entitled images on the web, past, present and future. In it, he outlined his thoughts on where the web is going in terms of support for different image formats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside text images are the bedrock of webpages. We browse the internet and expect pages to have images of all forms. Photos, illustrations, charts and images to convey additional meaning to the text.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how do the images actually get on the page? WordPress makes handling images pretty easy, and Adam explains what happens when you upload an image to the media library and then display it on a page or post in a browser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discussed the fact that different image sizes are created automatically by WordPress, which can be used in a variety of contexts across your website. You&#8217;ve likely heard of many of them. But perhaps you have not thought about which image format belongs where.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with code, the technology behind images does not stand still. New image formats are being created all the time, and are being supported at differing rates by the major browser vendors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, we typically used JPEG. GIF or PNG files to display images on our websites, but there&#8217;s good reason to think about adopting other defaults in the near future. We discussed some of these new formats, such as WebP, AVIF and JPEG XL, and find out how they are speeding up website loading times because of their smaller file sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also get into how you can optimize your images and how plugins and SaaS solutions can reduce the size of your files before or after you upload them to your WordPress install.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam has some good advice about a topic which is becoming increasingly important, page load time. And if you&#8217;ve never given the serious thought, this is a great podcast episode for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically when we record the podcast, there&#8217;s not a lot of background noise. But that&#8217;s not always the case. Over the coming weeks, I&#8217;ll be bringing you recordings from a recent trip to WordCamp US 2022, and you might notice that the recordings have a little echo or other strange audio artifacts. Whilst the podcasts are more than listenable, I hope that you understand that the vagaries of the real world were at play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all the links in the show notes by heading over to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast. Where you&#8217;ll find all of the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Adam Silverstein.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Adam Silverstein. Did I get that right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:38] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> You did. That&#8217;s the way I like to pronounce it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Perfect. Adam is here because he did a presentation at Word Camp US this year. What was the presentation about Adam?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:46] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> It was images on the web, past, present, and future. So kind of like a history of images and also what&#8217;s coming in the future for modern image formats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. We&#8217;ll delve into that in a moment, but before we do, would you just give us the two minute potted history of Adam. How it is that you&#8217;ve come to speak at a WordCamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:02] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Sure. Yeah. I mean, I used to build sites in, uh, Dreamweaver. Then I discovered WordPress as a way to let my clients be able to edit their content. Then one day I decided I should contribute back to WordPress. I became super involved in Core and help rewrite revisions for 3.6. Eventually, I became a core comitter. And, worked at agency, 10up, for quite a while, and then eventually wound up on the CMS team at Google. Working on the web platform, trying to make the web platform better. And I still work on WordPress quite a bit in that role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Google seemed to be doing a lot more with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:33] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Absolutely. Since about 2017 when they started showing up at every WordCamp. And also they have that first party plugin Site Kit, which is their own plugin that&#8217;s very well supported that connects your WordPress site to Google Services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, we spoke to Felix a few episodes ago. So, if you&#8217;re into Site Kit and things like that, you can search for the Felix Arntz episode. But we&#8217;re here to talk about images today. And I&#8217;m going to lead off with something which is going to make me sound incredibly ignorant, and apologize for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is simply this. When I visit a webpage or I&#8217;m building a website, images basically just magically appear. They&#8217;re on my computer. I see that there&#8217;s an image, there&#8217;s a file name and a file format, JPEG and so on and so forth. But I honestly have no idea how the browser makes the image appear. I don&#8217;t know what the mystery voodoo that&#8217;s going on in the background to turn a piece of code, I&#8217;m guessing, into something visible on the screen. So ridiculous as it may sound. How do we even get images on the web? How does it work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:31] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yeah, so it&#8217;s not a stupid question because it&#8217;s it&#8217;s incredibly complex, actually how browsers deal with images. But at a very basic level, typically there&#8217;s a lot of ways images actually appear on webpages, because it could be in your css or you could load it dynamically with JavaScript.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in a normal HTML context, you have an image tag, and that image tag has a url. When the browser first gets your HTML page, it goes through a parsing phase where it tries to decipher what all the elements that I&#8217;m gonna need to construct this visual page. What CSS do I need, what images do I need?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it goes through the HTML and each time it encounters an image. It makes another request back to your web server, that&#8217;s running WordPress. And then that image is brought back to the browser. Now that&#8217;s a binary format, that image. So the browser also has to have a capability of decoding that image. That&#8217;s where support for different image formats come in, and all the browsers support all the formats that we&#8217;re used to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then there&#8217;s these more modern formats that maybe aren&#8217;t supported. That&#8217;s kind of the simple version of it, is the browser finds the reference that you have on your HTML. Goes out and retrieves it, just like it does any asset, and then it decompresses it and puts it on your display.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If I was to look at the binary code, which made up the image. Which I presume is possible? Is it just a combination of letters, numbers, and characters?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:46] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> I mean, it&#8217;s binary encoding, so I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t actually know what, it&#8217;s eight bit probably, or 16 bit encoding. But you&#8217;ll have, typically at the first bites of an image will be like a header block. That defines what the image is, the meta information about the image. And then you&#8217;ll have the actual data of the image. And that&#8217;s in chunks. And it depends on how, what image compression format you&#8217;re using.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But typically images are compressed. So you have some information about that compression in the header, and then you have the chunks that make up the file. But it wouldn&#8217;t be something, if you looked at it, it wouldn&#8217;t make any sense to a human.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:18] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> It would just be like binary data, just a bunch of numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It kind of reminds me a little bit of TCPIP packets, you know, it&#8217;s surrounded with metadata to give, well, in this case it would be the, the OS stack. But, to give the browser information about what&#8217;s coming down the pipe in the next moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:32] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So how big it is, what the dimensions are, and so on and so forth. And then each little bit will render I guess a pixel or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:40] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Exactly. You could think of it that way. But you know, in a lot of these compression engines, it&#8217;s actually like an eight by eight block, and then there&#8217;s more detail. It&#8217;s very complicated really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even the thing about, like, I very much simplified the how the webpage is loaded because the browser has to decide which resources to load first and which to prioritize. And also just think about an image tag. Image tags now typically have a source set attribute, which indicates which size image we want, depending on the break point that we&#8217;re in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the browser has to figure out that information as well. It&#8217;s quite complex and people have written whole articles on it. So if you&#8217;re interested in it, there&#8217;s, like in my talk, I&#8217;ve got like a links document and there&#8217;s some links that I&#8217;ve put out to like how browsers work. It is very interesting to understand and I think it, like, can help inform, just the more you understand that, the more you understand why trying to optimize performance is so complex.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It really does amaze me, and these days, images on the connection at least that I have in my home, seem to load more or less instantaneously, but I remember going back in the day when it was dial up, this laborious line by line creation of the image. You could watch the image load and it would just sort of generate going down. Do you remember seeing all of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:51] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> You could see it loading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You could actually see the image loading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:53] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> And you could simulate that, you know, in Chrome using the throttling, in Chrome dev. But the other thing to remember is that, we&#8217;re a little privileged here. We have very high speed connections. We have high powered devices, but if you look at the world as a whole, that&#8217;s really not the case. There&#8217;s still a lot of people in the world who are using low powered, they&#8217;re using a phone, it&#8217;s not like a smartphone, like an iPhone. It&#8217;s a very low powered device. So even just the decoding of the images can be expensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the bandwidth thing,. Some people, a lot of places in the world, people are paying for bandwidth. So the more bandwidth you use. So they may have images turned off or they may be in a low data mode. A lot of phones support a low data mode where they&#8217;ll try to reduce the amount of data that they&#8217;re using.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting. One of the things we introduced recently into Word Press Core is native lazy loading of images. So this is something we used to do in JavaScript, but now is built into browsers. And what it does is it prevents the images that are off your view port from loading until you start scrolling down. Before you reach them, when you start scrolling, as you get closer to the where they&#8217;re gonna appear, then it will load those images. So, of course this is great for saving resource because when your page loads, if it&#8217;s a long page with many images, you don&#8217;t have to load all those images unless and until the user starts scrolling down the page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this sounds great, and especially at, in a high speed connection environment, it works great. But someone gave the feedback during the process of introducing this, that they work on a low bandwidth connection. And what they like to do is start loading the page and then they switch to another tab and they wait till everything loads and then they come back and they read all their content. But with lazy loading, it doesn&#8217;t work very well because suddenly they scroll a little bit and now they have to wait for another image to load.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m imagining that typical user is not browsing the web in that way. But that is an interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:31] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Isn&#8217;t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Is an interesting case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:32] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> What it just brings up is that you really have to think about your users. When you&#8217;re trying to optimize your site, it&#8217;s not just optimizing for yourself, it&#8217;s optimizing for your users. And that&#8217;s why having real user metrics is so valuable. Collecting actual field data about how people are experiencing your website, as opposed to doing lab tests like we are running lighthouse or page speed insights to try to figure out like, oh, how&#8217;s my site performing? That gives you one metric, but that doesn&#8217;t tell you how people actually in the wild experience your website. If most people have low bandwidth connections, that&#8217;s gonna be really different than what you might get from a local test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Let&#8217;s just pivot a little bit and talk about the different types of images there are. I would imagine almost everybody is familiar with the regular, the usual suspects, shall we say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:12] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You know, the JPEGs and the PNGs, and don&#8217;t even know if that&#8217;s how you pronounce it. Some people I&#8217;ve heard say, ping. But I always say PNG and I say GIF.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:20] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yes, and I say GIF.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, yeah, but there&#8217;s all of these. There&#8217;s more, which we&#8217;ll get onto later. But presumably there&#8217;s dozens more that are not typically used on the web. Why have these formats evolved over time? Why don&#8217;t we just have one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:33] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Right, that&#8217;s a great question, I mean, uh, the GIF format came out 35 years ago, and it pretty much did everything we needed to do, right? It could display images, it had animation, it had transparency. Wow, like images on the web. That was actually a big deal at the time. But there were some limitations. It only had 256 colors. So if you wanted to make a photograph, you had to dither the colors and it only had lossless compression, which is not really that efficient. You know, you maybe get 10 or 15%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it also had copyright issues. The LZW compression algorithm that was in GIF, there were copyright holders. Big corporations and the free software movement didn&#8217;t feel that they could trust this format. That&#8217;s part of why PNG came about 15 years ago, was as a response to the limitations of the compression algorithm, the copyrights. Of course PNG also added alpha transparency, which is an improved version of transparency because you can define opacity on a per pixel basis, and this lets you create an image with a transparent background that&#8217;s got like smooth edges. Like GIF images with transparent have those like blocky edges. But with a PNG, you can create a gradual fading to opacity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was a big improvement. So it actually added a really useful feature. It&#8217;s great for product images, PNGs. Of course, JPEG introduced lossy compression, which let you just tune your compression to whatever level you wanted. You could get 10 times smaller images that still look good, which was really important at that time. But you could also fine tune that if you were a photographer and you wanted higher quality, you could choose that higher quality setting. That was really unique. GIF didn&#8217;t have that, right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And SVG of course is the fourth kind of major one that we use on the web. And that&#8217;s just like very different. It&#8217;s for illustrations. It&#8217;s vector based instead of raster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s a file format isn&#8217;t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:12] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> It is, it&#8217;s actually XML, think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:14] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Unfortunately it also includes scripting, which means that we don&#8217;t support it in core because of the security concerns. But it&#8217;s also very specific to like illustration type formats. That&#8217;s where it really shines. It has some big advantages. It can be styled with css. You can&#8217;t do that with other image formats. What I&#8217;m trying to get at is that each format introduced new capabilities that were important at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We started to talk about modern image formats, which I include WebP in, even though it&#8217;s 12 years old at this point. What&#8217;s really cool about WebP is, it kind of combines all the features that came before. So it has the alpha transparency of PNG, but it also has the lossy compression of JPEG.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So suddenly you can take a transparent PNG and you get 80% improved compression, by making it into a transparent WebP. You still get all the features you need, the alpha transparency, but the compression is lossy now, which is impossible for we didn&#8217;t have a format that had both lossy and alpha transparency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WebP kind of is like, essentially trying to be all the things you need. Like if we had started with WebP, we probably wouldn&#8217;t have ever needed another format, because it supports animation, it supports lossy and lossless compression, it supports alpha transparency. It also has better compression than JPEG, like 30% better on average for the same quality. So it&#8217;s a big improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there&#8217;s a couple other formats that are upcoming, I would say. AVIF is probably the next one. It was just, support was just announced in Safari for AVIF. So Edge is the only remaining browser, major browser, that doesn&#8217;t support it. And the big promise of AVIF really over WebP is not on features, it&#8217;s just the compression that it achieves. And it&#8217;s able to achieve a 50% improvement over JPEG. So it&#8217;s very promising.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the one other one that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s kind of coming up that&#8217;s even newer is called JPEG XL. And this is from the same group that made JPEG and it&#8217;s just like a way, way better compression, like AVIF, but it has more affinity to JPEG so it works better with existing JPEGs. Like, it can losslessly recode existing JPEGs. The problem with JPEG XL, at least right now, is that it&#8217;s so new that it&#8217;s not really supported anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s a couple things that have happened. There&#8217;s been a lot of advances in compression over the years. A lot of them actually related to video, because we&#8217;ve, we started streaming video on the web and a lot of investment went into making those compressions better. And then those, like the AVI video format is the basis, the same compression, forms the basis of AVIF, hence the naming similarity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure about the WebP, the history of, of like where that compression algorithm came from, but the, the goal was to create something that was better than JPEG. Higher quality at the same size, or smaller size at the same quality. You can think of it in, in either way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. I remember back in the day, I hate to age myself in this way, but I remember Internet Explorer six, and the enormous fun that we had with trying to get transparency and the sort of kludges that you had to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:00] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> To get it wo work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, a little JavaScript snippet so that you could get transparency and so on. And so that tells me that, at certain points in. history, certain image formats have not been available in browsers. Broadly speaking, there&#8217;s probably three or four browsers that the majority of people on Earth are using these days. We know what they&#8217;re called. But do they support all of these? Really, the reason I&#8217;m asking this question is, let&#8217;s say I&#8217;ve got a website and I&#8217;ve got 10,000 images on website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I, I now have learned that there&#8217;s a potentially 30% benefit in getting them rendered as, let&#8217;s say, WebP or, or any of the other ones that you mentioned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:37] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Would you say it&#8217;s worthwhile doing that work and re rendering them as, let&#8217;s say, WebP or something like that? Or should I just carry on and do the new formats for the new images? Or like I said, go back and redo them all?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:50] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yeah, I mean, it probably depends on how much actual traffic you get on those older posts. I think a lot of people have older posts on their site that get very little traffic, and then I would say it&#8217;s probably not worth updating it. With the filter that we have in place in core to control the output, you can use regenerate images and regenerate all your old images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And get that WebP benefit, like switch from JPEG to WebP for your old files. There are some caveats there. You need to make sure that the images have been inserted from the editor so that they&#8217;re actually replaced in the HTML. Because if you&#8217;re changing all your image file names, you don&#8217;t want to have broken images in your old posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So WordPress does do that on the fly, where we, if you insert an image from the editor, then it has like a WP image class name. So we can identify the source image and then we go and we, we build that source set into the HTML by looking at the metadata about the image. So when you do that regenerate images, it updates the metadata and therefore you&#8217;ll get the new images even in your old posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s not guaranteed. If you have really old posts or they don&#8217;t have that WP class, and then for some reason, because you maybe built it with a page builder tool, for example, that doesn&#8217;t include those, there are scenarios where that could break your images. And all the regenerate images plugins have options around this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like um, WPCLI, you know, you can have it not delete the old images. So if you have URLs that are still out there referring to the old images, that&#8217;ll work. Or another example is you might have a third party site that has embedded your image. If you&#8217;re okay with that and you don&#8217;t want to break that, then you want to avoid changing your file name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:13] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> So it depends a lot on your use case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:15] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Caveat emptor really. Just give it a bit of thought. In terms of the browsers. What is the support like for, well obviously we know that the usual suspects that we mentioned at the beginning. The age old ones, GIFs and PNGs and JPEGs, that&#8217;s fine?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:29] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What about the other ones? What about the WebPs and the AVIFs and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:33] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yeah. So the great place to check is the, can I use website, right? They&#8217;ve got all the details but, right now WebP is supported in all the browsers, very widely supported. The only exception is older versions of Safari, and Safari support actually depends on the underlying operating system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this means that users have to upgrade to, I think it&#8217;s two versions ago of MacOS. So there is a small percentage of users out there that have this older Safari version that won&#8217;t load WebPs correctly. It&#8217;s actually very difficult to tell how many because there&#8217;s a bug, in like one of the subsequent versions of Safari where the user agent string misreported the OS version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So between a couple versions of Safari and iOS or MacOS, you actually can&#8217;t tell the difference from logs. And so we don&#8217;t have good data about that in the wild, but from the data that we have, we think it&#8217;s between 1 and 2% of browser users in the world that don&#8217;t support WebP currently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Dare I ask, was there any politics in Safari not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:26] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Supporting it? I don&#8217;t think so. I mean, people say, oh, it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a Google format. Like it&#8217;s an open source format that Google developed. But it is widely supported across a huge number of applications. There&#8217;s a lot of criticism of Safari for under investing in web capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if this really falls into that. I do think that Apple as a company has a vested interest in keeping their app ecosystem more powerful than the web ecosystem. So I think there&#8217;s sort of some natural tension there, but I probably wouldn&#8217;t blame the Safari team. My expectation is the Safari team is all on board on making the web better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s a big corporation and there&#8217;s different interests. So there could be some political part to it, but I, not that I&#8217;m aware of. Safari, just to continue like the AVIF is sort of the next one. And Safari did just recently announce AVIF support. I think they&#8217;re just slower to adopt some things than other browsers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:15] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I guess if I&#8217;m using WordPress and images are a key component. I do want to be really mindful that, that number, the percentage. So you think at the moment WebP is about 98% of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:26] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> 98 to 99.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So, at some point the Rubicon got crossed and you can say to. yourself, that&#8217;s fine. The percentage is easily high enough. I can confidently use WebP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:35] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How about the other formats? Also just staying on the WebP, let&#8217;s do that bit. first. Would you recommend people to shift over to WebP henceforth?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:44] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Or is there, is there a good reason to stay with the older formats?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:47] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> The only reason I would say not use WebP would be is if you knew most of your users were all on older Safari versions. Or you sent newsletters out to Windows users using Outlook, which is one other use case. We know that doesn&#8217;t support WebP. But this is like old versions of Outlook running on Windows. Not modern outlook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I guess at some point you just have to take the plunge and say there&#8217;s enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:07] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yeah, Well, and we do have a support shim for Safari. So in the browser, if the page is loading WebPs, we add this little bit of JavaScript, it&#8217;s a tiny little bit that does feature detection. So it can actually detect whether the browser supports WebP. And at that point, if it doesn&#8217;t support WebP, we can actually swap the images and use the JPEGs that we do have available, We use like the next largest size that&#8217;s available. And with the current implementation, that would be either your original image or like the one of the H, high definition images that WordPress automatically creates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there will be, like, the primary sizes would be WebP, but there would be still be some available sizes in JPEG. If nothing else, the original image. So that means that your Safari users will still see images, they&#8217;ll just get a slower experience. So 1% of users will get a degraded experience. 99% users will get an improved experience, and then it&#8217;s up to you to decide whether it&#8217;s worth it. But at least those Safari users won&#8217;t be totally left out in the dark. They&#8217;ll still be able to see your images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s really curious. For some reason I have this atrophy and I&#8217;ve known that WebP was at about 98. And I put several images online each and every week, maybe a, a dozen or so. And for some reason I always export them as a JPEG. I haven&#8217;t managed in my own mind to say, this is now the moment. I think you&#8217;ve convinced me. I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:20] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yeah. But I mean, in my opinion, like that really shouldn&#8217;t be up to users to understand that or figure that out. I mean, if you&#8217;re very technical, if you&#8217;re a photographer, maybe. But for the average WordPress user, they don&#8217;t know what image format they&#8217;re using. So this is why, it should be like a core capability where it just happens for users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Okay, so WebP, that&#8217;s great. But you, you mentioned a couple of others. There was JPEG, I wanted to say JPEG 2. What was it, JPEG?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:46] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> XL.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> JPEG XL.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:50] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> And there&#8217;s a bunch of JPEGs actually. There was one called JPEG 2000 that you might remember that was pushed by the JPEG foundation, or organization, for a while, and that was never adopted. But yeah, let&#8217;s talk about those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So they, they&#8217;re presumably growing in use? Are they safe to use at the moment? Would you recommend, for example, my website using those image formats? Or Should I wait a little bit longer?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:07] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Probably wait a little bit longer, yeah. Safari doesn&#8217;t support it yet. They&#8217;ve announced support, it&#8217;s coming out and whenever the next Mac OS comes out, I think it&#8217;s like this week or something. Or it&#8217;s soon. It&#8217;s very soon. But that means that they&#8217;re just starting support so you probably want to wait till a significant number of users are actually on that version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:23] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Which in the Apple ecosystem actually happens pretty quickly. People generally, you know, there&#8217;s a very large percentage of users who will go to the next OS version very quickly. It doesn&#8217;t cost anything. And it&#8217;s like they&#8217;ve proven that it&#8217;s safe. Um, they have a pretty good uptick rate. So yeah, I mean, the only way, if you really wanted to take advantage of AVIF, we have a couple options. One is using an image CDN. So the advantage of an image CDN is that, it can actually negotiate the format.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when browsers make a request for an image, they actually can indicate in their header, in their request headers, which formats they&#8217;re capable of decoding. And that means that the image CDN can be like, oh, you, you take AVIF? I&#8217;ll give you AVIF. That&#8217;s the best one that we have. But if it doesn&#8217;t support AVIF, okay, how about WebP? You support that? Okay. No, you don&#8217;t support any of those? We&#8217;ll give you the JPEG version. The CDN can use this capability negotiation at header time, to deliver the best image. And also they can resize the image to exactly meet the size specifications of your HTML, which WordPress doesn&#8217;t do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress generates several sizes, and then we pick the best size that&#8217;s the closest to the one that you&#8217;ve put on your page. And also we can&#8217;t do the header negotiation because we don&#8217;t handle the image requests. Those are handled by Apache or whatever web server you&#8217;re running Nginx, you know. You have a web server running, it actually handles the image request directly. WordPress has no involvement in that whatsoever. And there are plugins that do this, the only way that you can interact with that is, is using like htaccess. There are some ways to do it, but there generally outside of cores scope.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Typically, would this CDN be the kind of thing that you would negotiate with your hosting provider?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:56] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Some hosting providers provide it. There&#8217;s of course all kinds of third party CDNs. Jetpack provides an image CDN as one example. Some of them are free, some of them are paid. I think every major CDN has a WordPress plugin that will directly integrate. So you don&#8217;t really have to do much to set it up, maybe put your login or your key in or something. So I would say like, if you can hook up with an image CDN, then you&#8217;re sort of automatically able to take advantage of the latest versions of images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah that sounds like the way to do it, if you can stretch to that. That sounds like the best way because you can just forget about it. Everything will be taken care of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:26] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Exactly. If you have a reason that you can&#8217;t do it or there&#8217;s a cost associated with it. Your best bet is probably to stick with WebP for now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:32] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Because that is so widely supported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> On that point, are there particular types of images that you would recommend given a certain scenario? So, for example, let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m taking wildlife photography. Fairly specific example, but there&#8217;s an awful lot on the image. There&#8217;s dark areas, light areas. Lots of color. Let&#8217;s say for example, I&#8217;m creating some graphic design and it&#8217;s fairly plain, it&#8217;s text based. There&#8217;s not a lot going on in there. Is there a preferred way in, at least in your mind, or is it always WebP?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:58] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> I mean, there are definitely cases where WebP like really performs better, and there&#8217;s cases where JPEG performs almost as well as WebP I guess. And even there are images where the WebP will be slightly larger than the JPEG, in certain cases to get the same quality. You know, I would say certainly if you&#8217;re doing illustration, something that&#8217;s like a line art, then if it could be an SVG, that&#8217;s probably gonna be your most efficient format.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But other than that, I think probably WebP is gonna win out on average, right? So you can look at specific images and find that maybe one would be better as JPEG, one would be better as WebP. But in general, if you take all your image is an aggregate, you&#8217;re gonna be way better off going with WebP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the exception to that would be like, is if you are a photographer and what you&#8217;re showing on your website is your photography, and you want it to be like the absolute highest quality. You maybe already have changed the default quality that WordPress uses, and maybe you just want to stick with JPEG so that you know that you&#8217;re getting exactly what you&#8217;re used to. There is a visual difference between JPEG and WebP and, you know, there&#8217;s all these tools that, that they use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I talk about it a little bit in my talk about, how do you measure quality? It&#8217;s a very subjective thing actually. There&#8217;s algorithms, so when I&#8217;m talking about how do you measure quality, So let&#8217;s say you take an image and you compress it with a JPEG and then you&#8217;re comparing it to something you&#8217;ve compressed with WebP and you say, oh, the WebP is smaller. That&#8217;s great. But it&#8217;s not that great if also the quality is lower, right? If the quality is the same and the file smaller, you win. But if the file smaller and the quality is degraded, then is that really something you want? So that you have to look at both quality and file size as two parts of the same discussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s very interesting how we think about quality. I think, I have a slide in my talk where I have two images and there are very different compression qualities, but you actually can&#8217;t tell the difference on the screen because it&#8217;s blurry and you&#8217;re looking at a screen from 30 feet away. And the point is that it matters, the context where you&#8217;re gonna be viewing that matters. If it&#8217;s a little thumbnail, you&#8217;re not going to really matter if it&#8217;s like some pixels that are off. But if you&#8217;re looking at like that big gorgeous wildlife photography and you&#8217;re a photographer, you want the best possible quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I guess it&#8217;s a case by case basis, isn&#8217;t It?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:00] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> It is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong>Just suddenly occurred to me that we didn&#8217;t talk about how WordPress deals with images. We have the media library. I would imagine that&#8217;s how most people interact with their images on WordPress. You go into the media library and you upload things, drag them in and what have you. But there&#8217;s all sorts of wizardry going on right at that moment where you pull the image in for the first time. And, potentially people listening to this, they won&#8217;t know about that. So.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:20] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Are you able to run through that quickly?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:22] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Sure, so when you upload your image to WordPress. You&#8217;re uploading your original image, and then WordPress is gonna create a series of subsidized images. By default it has I think four, it&#8217;s actually six sizes built in. Four that you can see in the settings, or three that you can see in the settings screens. Thumbnail, medium and large. There&#8217;s also a medium large size that we added. And then there&#8217;s also two HDMI, high definition screen sizes, that are like even larger than the large size.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you upload your image, WordPress will go through this kind of crunching phase where it generates all of these subsidized images, and then those can be used later on the front end, depending on your context. So if it&#8217;s a thumbnail image, it&#8217;s gonna use that really small image. If it&#8217;s a larger image, it&#8217;ll use the larger one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we sort of pre-create these images when you upload. That process uses, uh, one of two libraries on the backend that tie into your web server. One&#8217;s called LibGD, which is now built into php. And the other one&#8217;s called ImageMagick, or people call it Image Magic. That&#8217;s like the GUI for it. And both of those libraries are available in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have built in image handling classes for them. I will say you can also extend the image library to add your own image handling class, but I&#8217;m not aware of specific implementations. But those are sort of the two that we support out of the box. And they&#8217;re very popular and common in php. Like I said, GD&#8217;s built into php now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those libraries may or may not support different formats. So getting back to your question of which format is supported. In order to be able to use AVIF with WordPress, we really need that server support. because if the server can&#8217;t read AVIF, if that means when you upload an AVIF file or you upload a JPEG and you&#8217;re trying to output AVIF, it can&#8217;t do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t know how to do that. So until we get to PHP 8.1, which supports AVIF, we&#8217;re probably not going to be able to support directly AVIF in WordPress. So there&#8217;s that server dependency that you have. And also, just to add a little wrinkle to that is that, GD supports WebP or, you know, Imagemagick supports AVIF, but only if it&#8217;s built with that. So literally at compile time, someone has to build the web server, right? It&#8217;s written in C or whatever assembly, like whatever code it&#8217;s written in, and then someone has to compile and they have to decide, am I including the AVIF i library? Am I including the WebP library? And so whether you have support for those depends on your host.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like what is their hosting stack, what is the distribution that they&#8217;re using? It&#8217;s a wide variety of things out there. But yeah, that&#8217;s the general process. You upload, the images get generated, and then, when you insert the image into your post WordPress will use all of those images. They&#8217;ll use it in the source set to build out the responsive design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> As with all things WordPress there&#8217;s plugins that step in and do additional features. I mean you can code this yourself but you know, you can create other image sizes that WordPress will create on the fly, soon as you, you know, you crunch an image. Yeah, but also there&#8217;s this curious third party industry of image s smushing, I want to call it. You know where, when it&#8217;s uploaded, and I believe also WordPress itself now has a maximum, you know, if you&#8217;ve got a vanilla install of WordPress there&#8217;s a, what is it? What&#8217;s the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:15] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> It&#8217;s It&#8217;s like a max threshold size for image uploads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. That, I suppose is a useful thing to talk about. The idea that, okay, so you&#8217;ve got this brand new beautiful camera, which is taking images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:27] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Sixteen megapixels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Right, and honestly you&#8217;ve got a 10 megabyte image but you&#8217;re intending to display it as a thumbnail in the corner of your post or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:34] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The intention, therefore, from these third party plugins and, and what have you, is to take that image and just reduce it. Make it teeny tiny. Why do we do that? What&#8217;s the benefit to begin there? You talked about bandwidth and all of that earlier. Is that the only reason that we&#8217;re doing, it&#8217;s just to save on bandwidth?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:52] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> And to speed up the loading of the page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:54] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> So, and just to Expand on that. It&#8217;s not really just about the speed of the page, but it&#8217;s about the experience of your users visiting your website. If you have slow images that are too large for what you need, then you are giving your users a poor experience. There&#8217;s all kinds of studies that show that by improving the loading time and responsiveness of your website, you get better results. So whatever those goals may be, conversions into newsletter subscribers or people who purchase products, or someone who reads more than one article on your website. Those things are all enhanced by having a better user experience. And so if we&#8217;re talking about optimizing images, we&#8217;re really talking about creating a better user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You&#8217;re wearing your Google t-shirt today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:35] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you know you&#8217;re doing all all the right things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:37] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Google google loves open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You are not on the search team, so maybe this question is not gonna be one that&#8217;s right in your wheelhouse, but I&#8217;m gonna ask it anyway. SEO and search engine results. I&#8217;m presuming there is a benefit because you know, in the last couple of years we&#8217;ve all been thinking about Core Web Vitals and that&#8217;s been a big push from Google, and everybody&#8217;s taken that very seriously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:56] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And, you know, is there a benefit to your search position, should you take the time to do images right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:04] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yes, and I&#8217;ll say that it&#8217;s only really a very small benefit. Really what gets you the best position in search results is having the best content. And if I have an article about Bartlett pears growing in San Diego and someone Googles it, and I&#8217;m the only article about that on the web, they&#8217;re gonna go right to me. No matter how performant my site is. Where performance comes in is as a waiting factor, like many, many other factors as a signal to Google. Just like HTTPS, mobile support. These are all signals that Google has announced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, uh, you&#8217;re not gonna be like, penalized for poor performance. It&#8217;s more that if all other things are equal, this could be a weighting factor that would bump you up, having a better experience for your users. But that really shouldn&#8217;t be your motivation. Your motivation should be creating a better experience for your users first, and then secondly better achieving your goals once people reach your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So someone described it as a funnel, right? People think of web conversions as a funnel. You start at the top, all the people who see your search results, and then it gets smaller. All the people who click on your search results. And then, all the people who actually do something on your website. And then finally, this tiny, small number of people that convert to being paying customers. And I, and in my hands here just for audio, I&#8217;m going from wide to smaller. And where the user experience parts helps, uh, improving user pitch is not up here at the top in getting more search results. It&#8217;s here where once users reach your site, then you&#8217;re gonna really see that benefit. And so, that&#8217;s where you should think about where the benefit comes. It comes from turning those visiting users into actual, whatever your goal is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, I&#8217;m gonna go slightly off piste. Google does a fantastic job. I use Google photos, and Google Photos is able to identify the objects in my photos. And so I did wonder if there was a potential Google search. So, for example if I have a website I don&#8217;t label, I don&#8217;t put any metadata on my images at all. Does Google do any of that? This website is full of trees, and so if I search for a particular tree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:05] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> That&#8217;s a really good question. I don&#8217;t know the answer. I would say, first of all, please put alt tags on your images. Don&#8217;t do that. Because there&#8217;s a reason we have alt tags. Actually someone, so it&#8217;s the reason, the big reason is of course, accessibility, right. People who are visually impaired can&#8217;t see your images. It&#8217;s nice if they have a description of what they&#8217;re missing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Someone actually today came by and said, do you think there&#8217;s a way we could take image recognition and make it so that non sighted users touch over the image, they get a description of what they&#8217;re seeing. So, if you&#8217;re a non sight user, I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever seen people, a lot of times they actually use a touchscreen that&#8217;s haptic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:38] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> So they can move over and they can feel the buttons, right. It&#8217;s not just, having the buttons described to them in text, but literally a screen that as you&#8217;re moving over elements of the page, it bumps up. So you can actually feel, oh, there&#8217;s a button. That&#8217;s where the home button is, and then they can tap it, right? So they already have this technology, screens that are like this, and of course visually impair people are, are often used to reading braille, so they&#8217;re very sensitive with their fingers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So imagine something where you have a picture of trees and a person and a visually impaired person could move their hand over and say like, oh, there&#8217;s the person and there&#8217;s trees back here, and they&#8217;re feeling the image. Like that would be amazing. And that would again, require that same visual recognition of images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That is a truly, astonishingly good idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:14] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Right, I had never heard that idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That is just mind blowingly clever. Let&#8217;s hope that somebody can build that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:21] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yeah. There was another, just one more that someone posted recently to Twitter, you might have seen, but it&#8217;s the, it&#8217;s like the DALL E tools that are out now with the image generation. So someone has built a WordPress plugin in Gutenberg where you type in, like you&#8217;re working on your post and it&#8217;s about Bartlett pears in San Diego. So you type in like Bartletts flying across the San Diego Bay, and it generates an image for you of that. You&#8217;re there in Gutenberg and you just insert it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The whole AI piece. Rewind the clock just two years, and I thought it was, no, this is going nowhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:51] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> At no point in the future will you be able to tell a computer to create an image or a piece of art, or replicate, well, almost anything, but especially the things which don&#8217;t exist. You know, the triangle dog or whatever it might be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:04] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And, and yet you input it in and just in the space of two years, it&#8217;s gone me laughing at it. To me, just being in awe of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:13] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> It&#8217;s amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s truly amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:15] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yeah, so I use one of those tools to generate all the images in my slideshow for my presentation yesterday. So I have like hilarious images, like a raccoon surf boarding and a, a goat driving a race car.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:26] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Impossible things, but they look, you know, if you look closely, you can see some weird details. They&#8217;re very, very accurate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There&#8217;s lots of them as well. I believe the one that captured my attention recently, I think it was called Mind Journey or something like. It&#8217;s implementation is to create art.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:43] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you give it the, the thing that you feed it is, I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;d like a picture of a sunset that resembles Rembrandt, with a red sky to the left and so on. And it completely does it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:54] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> That&#8217;s amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, an absolute miracle. Adam Silverstein, thank you so much for joining me on the podcast today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:00] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> It was fun. Thank you.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/adamsilverstein/\">Adam Silverstein</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam is a WordPress core comitter where he works to fix bugs and improve modern web capabilities. As a Developer Relations Engineer in the content ecosystem team at Google, he works to invigorate the open web by empowering and educating developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the recent WordCamp US, he gave a presentation entitled ‘Images on the Web &#8211; past present and future’. In it, he outlined his thoughts on where the web is going in terms of support for different image formats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside text, images are the bedrock of webpages. We browse the internet and expect pages to have images of all forms. Photos, illustrations, charts and images to convey additional meaning to the text.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how do the images actually get on the page? WordPress makes handling images pretty easy, and Adam explains what happens when you upload an image to the Media Library, and then display it on a page or post in a browser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss the fact that different image sizes are created automatically by WordPress, which can be used in a variety of contexts across your website. You’ve likely heard of many of them, but perhaps you have not thought about which format belongs where.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with code, the technology behind images does not stand still. New formats are being created all the time and are being supported at differing rates by the major browser vendors. In the past we typically used JPEG, GIF or PNG files to display images on our websites, but there’s good reason to think about adopting other defaults in the near future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss some of these new formats, such as WebP, AVIF and JPEG XL, and find out about how they are speeding up website loading times because of their smaller file sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also get into how you can optimise your images, and how plugins and SaaS solutions can reduce the size of your files before or after you upload them to your WordPress install.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam has some good advice about a topic which is becoming increasingly important, page load time, and if you’ve never given this serious thought, this is a great podcast episode for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, when we record the podcast, there’s not a lot of background noise, but that’s not always the case. Over the coming weeks, I’ll be bringing you recordings from a recent trip to WordCamp US 2022, and you might notice that the recordings have a little echo or other strange audio artefacts. Whilst the podcasts are more than listenable, I hope you understand that the vagaries of the real world were at play.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/34-felix-arntz-on-wordpress-and-performance\">Jukebox Podcast episode 34 – Felix Arntz on WordPress and Performance</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://caniuse.com/\">Can I Use website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://libgd.github.io/\">LibGD graphics library</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-block-diffusion-plugin-creates-ai-generated-images-from-text-prompts\">New Block Diffusion Plugin Creates AI-Generated Images from Text Prompts</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.midjourney.com/home/\">Midjourney</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"HeroPress: Making The World A Better Place One Line Of Code At A Time\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=4906\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:190:\"https://heropress.com/essays/making-the-world-a-better-place-one-line-of-code-at-a-time/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=making-the-world-a-better-place-one-line-of-code-at-a-time\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16606:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/101922-min.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: Making The World A Better Place One Line Of Code At A Time.

At that time I was working as a designer for a company dedicated to sports and we were working internally on a kind of CMS to digitize our Football News magazine, but the result was horrendous, the interface did not exist, it constantly crashed and it was full of bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s how in the year 2008-2009 in an Internet search I discovered WP, its version at that time 2.5, I couldn&#8217;t get us to use WP as a CMS and the internal solution won. But there was one seed planted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that time I used WordPress in a very simple way, my background was a graphic designer, I didn&#8217;t know anything about PHP, much less about programming, but studying the WP code I was able to make my first themes, which by the way were terrible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I learned HTML and CSS, at the same time I started taking Programming courses, especially in PHP, and that&#8217;s how I started this adventure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first years were literally learning on my own, in my bubble, then I started to add the word web developer in my resume, I found a job in a company as a designer and web master, I designed gif banners, magazine ads, brochures and the website , this company had its page in ASP and since it was very complicated to update it, at least for me, I gave myself the task of migrating it to WordPress, it was 2014 and WP was in version 3.9, this was my first job in which I did everything from the design to the development and programming of the theme, in it I put into practice everything I had learned until then.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_d7c6c7-b7 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2016, I met Roberto Remedios, my tattoo artist who was also his tattoo artist, told him that if didn&#8217;t know me?, Costa Rica is a small country where one way or another we all have friends in common, he told him that my passion was WordPress, when we met we didn&#8217;t stop talking about how cool it was, but what caught my attention the most was the word Community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Community </strong>what was that?, I had spent so many years working on my own that I didn&#8217;t know that it even existed, my concept of Open Source was simply something free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roberto convinced me that same year to go to WordCamp Miami, it was my first camp, meeting the community behind WP was something that impressed me a lot, the talks, the desire to teach and learn from all the participants, and above all to collaborate with the community, wow everything changed for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we got back, Roberto and I started talking about the possibility of holding a WordCamp in San José, Costa Rica.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of that process is giving talks before the camp as a way to promote it, and as a member of the newly founded WordPress Costa Rica group, it was time for me to give a talk. It was the first time I spoke in front of the public since my student days, I remember how nervous I was, my talk revolved around page builders, there was no Gutenberg back then, I managed to get the Meetup sponsored, there were snacks, swags, A lot of people came, it was incredible. Colleagues who participated that day in that Meetup, are still an active part of the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I gave that same talk at WordCamp and it was even more stressful, because my computer did not turn on, at that moment they lent me a computer, but oh surprise I could not run my test site, after 20min I was able to solve the problem, the JavaScript was disabled. I was already sweating profusely, red with shame, in the end I was able to give the talk and everything ended well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp San Jose, it was incredible, it was hard work, very rewarding, it was a success, never before had I felt so good professionally, years had passed, without sharing something that I like so much with anyone, suddenly we had a community, we meet regularly, and share about what we are most passionate about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently my talks revolve around making my local community aware of new WordPress trends, I collaborate as an administrator of the WordPress Costa Rica group.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_fdbe32-4a wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Outside Costa Rica</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The second year that I attended WordCamp Miami, I participated as a volunteer, and I had the opportunity to interact with many of the humans that I follow on social media, and then I was encouraged to send talks and participate in the WordCamps that take place in my region. Eager to share what I have learned, to date I have participated as a volunteer, speaker, and organizer in my city Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Mexico and in the first Central American WordCamp which was held online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then came the talks in another language, I have had the opportunity to give talks in Rome, Italy, I participated as a volunteer in the WordCamp US, where I had the opportunity to meet colleagues and the CEO of a company that I admire a lot, this was in Nashville , U.S. seeing colleagues with whom I have had the privilege of working today, my circle of friends expanded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also had participate in online conferences, such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B33I2bvt6TQ\">GatsbyConf</a>, <a href=\"https://javascriptforwp.com/talks/gatsby-wordpress-alfredo-navas-fernandini/\">JavaScript For WordPress</a> and at <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2021/session/headless-wordpress- gatsby-or-nextjs/\">WordCamp EU 2021</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like to share and talk about JAMStack, especially with GatsbyJS and WordPress as a headless CMS.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_aa6505-fd wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Professional Path</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a lot to thank WordPress for, the first thing it brought was the curiosity to learn programming, then remote work. I started working for an agency located in Austin, Texas, with several collaborators in Costa Rica, it was the year 2017, they hired me for my knowledge in WordPress, it was not only the first time that I could work completely dedicated to WP, but also from my house, I never set foot in an office again, seeing my children grow up and above all working in flip flops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That same year, together with my wife, we founded a small specialized WordPress agency, which we still have and is managed by her. Our most recent work was the website for <a href=\"https://premiosacam.com/\">Costa Rican Music Awards</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_e72b3f-d5 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Expanding my Career</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I decided to pay attention to the Job Boards that you find when you go to a WordCamp, I was looking for the opportunity to work on larger projects, corporate projects where Icould expand my knowledge, I started applying, I was convinced that I had the level to work in a dedicated agency 100 % to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I worked for agencies in New York and DC but I was still searching for a place to really fit, and the opportunity came, with perseverance and effort today I work as a Senior Frontend Engineer, in the agency that I most admire, WebDevStudios, dedicated 100% to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress definitely changed my life personally and professionally, I have met incredible people and places, above all I have been able to give time and a quality life to my family, I have learned a lot, and still learning, I write about WordPress, I help my community teaching about the tools with which they can carry out their ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I am doing what I love the most, making the world a better place one line of code at a time.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 id=\"espanol\" class=\"kt-adv-heading_68c620-ba wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Hacer Del Mundo Un Lugar Mejor Una Linea De Codigo A La Vez</h1>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_c92a36-80 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Como Conoci WordPress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Parece que fue ayer cuando me dije a mi mismo&#8230; <strong>¿T</strong>iene que haber una mejor manera de hacer esto? En ese entonces me desempeñaba como diseñador para una empresa dedicada a los deportes y estábamos trabajando internamente en una especie de CMS para digitalizar nuestra revista Football News, pero el resultado era horrendo, la interface inexistente, se caía constantemente y estaba lleno de bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fue así como en el año 2008-2009 en una busqueda en la Internet descubrí WP, su versión en ese entonces 2.5, no logre que usaramos WP como CMS y la solución interna gano. Pero habia quedado una semillla,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En ese entonces usaba WordPress de una manera muy simple, mi background era disenador grafico, no sabía nada de PHP, mucho menos de programación, pero estudiando el código de WP pude hacer mis primeros temas, que por por cierto eran terribles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aprendi HTML, y CSS, al tiempo empece a llevar cursos de Programacion, sobre todo en PHP y así inicio esta aventura.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Los primero años fueron literalmente aprendiendo por mi cuenta, en mi burbuja, luego empeze a agregar la palabra desarrollador web en mi curriculum, encontre trabajo en una empresa como diseñador y web master, diseñaba gif banners, anucios para revista, brochures y la pagina web, esta empresa tenia su pagina en ASP y como era muy complicado actualizarla, al menos para mi, me di la tarea de migrarla a WordPress, era el 2014 y WP estaba en us version 3.9, este fue mi primer trabajo en cual hice todo desde el diseño hasta el desarrollo y programacion del tema, en el puse en practica todo lo que habia aprendido hasta ese entonces.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_6b09c6-ce wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Comunidad</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Y la vida siguio su rumbo y en el año 2016, conoci a Roberto Remedios, Mi tatuador que era a la vez su tatuador, le decia que <strong>¿S</strong>i no me conocia?, Costa Rica es un pais pequeño donde de alguna u otra forma todos tenemos amigos en comun, el le comentaba que mi pasion era WordPress, cuando nos conocimos no paramos de</p>\n\n\n\n<p>hablar sobre lo cool que era, pero lo que mas me llamo la atencion era la palabra Comunidad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>¿</strong>Comunidad que era eso?, habia pasado tantos años trabajando por mi cuenta que no sabia que eso si quiera existia, mi concepto de Open Source era simplemente algo gratis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roberto me convencio ese mismo año de ir WordCamp Miami, fue mi primer camp, conocer la comunidad que había detrás de WP fue algo que me impresionó mucho, las charlas, las ganas de enseñar y de aprender de todos los participantes, y sobre todo colaborar con la comunidad, wow todo cambio para mi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cuando regresamos Roberto y yo empezamos a conversar sobre la posibilidad de hacer un WordCamp en San José, Costa Rica.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parte de ese proceso es dar charlas antes del camp como una forma de promoverlo, y como miembro del recién fundado grupo de WordPress Costa Rica, me llego el momento de dar una charla. Era la primera vez que hablaba frente al publico desde mis tiempos de estudiante, recuerdo lo nervioso que estaba, mi charla giraba en torno a los page builders, no había gutenberg en ese entonces, logre que el Meetup fuera patrocinado, habian snacks, swags, llego bastante gente, fue increible. Colegas que participaron ese día en ese Meetup, aun forman parte activa de la comunidad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Esa misma charla la imparti en el WordCamp y fue aún más estresante, pues mi computador no encendió, en ese momento me prestaron una computadora, pero oh sorpresa no podía correr mi sitio de prueba, después de 20min pude solucionar el problema, el JavaScript estaba desactivado. ya sudaba a mares, rojo de la vergüenza, al final pude dar la charla y todo termino bien.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp San Jose, fue algo increible, fue un trabajo arduo, muy gratificante, fue un exito, nunca antes me habia sentido tan bien en mi lo profesional, habia pasado años, sin compartir con nadie algo que tanto me gusta, de repente teniamos una comunidad, nos reunimos habitualmente, y compartimos sobre lo que mas nos apasiona.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recientemente mis charlas giran en dar a conocer a mi comunidad local las nuevas tendencias de WordPress, colaboro como administrador del grupo de WordPress Costa Rica.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_d6d109-dc wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Fuera de Costa Rica</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>El segundo año que asistí al WordCamp Miami, participe como voluntario, y tuve la oportunida de poder interactuar con muchos de los humanos que sigo en redes sociales, y así luego me anime a enviar charlas y participar en los WordCamps que se realizan en mi region, con muchas ganas de compartir lo que he aprendido, al día de hoy he participado como voluntario, charlista, y organizador en mi ciudad Costa Rica, Nicaragua, México y en el primer WordCamp Centroamericano el cual se realizó en línea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luego vinieron las charlas en otro idioma, He tenido la oportunidad de dar charlas en Roma, Italia, participe como voluntario en el WordCamp US, donde tuve la oportunidad de conocer a colegas y al CEO de una empresa que admiro mucho, esto fue en Nashville, USA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>volver a ver a colegas con los que he hoy tenido el privilegio de trabajar, mi circulo de amigos se expandio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tambien tenido la oportunidad de participar en conferencias en línea, como en el GatsbyConf, JavaScript For WordPress y en el WordCamp EU 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me gusta compartir y dar charlas sobre el JAMStack, especialmente con GatsbyJS y WordPress como un headless CMS.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_1df56f-ba wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Professional Path</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tengo mucho que agradecer a WordPress, lo primero que trajo fue la curiosidad de aprender programación, luego el trabajo remoto. Al tiempo empecé a trabajar para una agencia localizada en Austin, Texas, con varios colaboradores en Costa Rica, corria el año 2017, me contrataron por mis conocimientos en WordPress, era no solo la primera vez que podía trabajar completamente dedicado a WP, si no tambien desde mi casa, nunca mas volví a pisar una oficina, ver a mis hijos crecer y sobre todo trabajar en chancletas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ese mismo año, junto a mi esposa, fúndanos una pequeña agencia especializada en WordPress, la cual aún tenemos y es manejada por ella. Nuestro más reciente trabajo, fue la página de los <a href=\"https://premiosacam.com/\">Premios de la Música Costarricense</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_a5a1dc-37 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Overseas</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Decidi prestar atención a los Job Board que encuentras cuando vas a un WordCamp, buscaba la oportunidad de trabajar en proyectos más grandes, proyectos corporativos donde podría expander mis conocimientos, empecé a aplicar, estaba convencido que tenia el nivel para trabajar en una agencia dedicada 100% a WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trabaje para agencias en New York y DC, y la oportunidad llego y con perseverancia y esfuerzo el dia de hoy trabajo como Senior Frontend Engineer, en la agencia que más admiro, WebDevStudios, dedicado 100% a WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress definitivamente cambio mi vida en lo personal y en lo profesional, he conocido lugares y gente increible, he podido sobre todo darle tiempo y una vida de calidad a mi familia, he aprendido mucho, y aun sigo aprendiendo, escribo sobre WordPress, ayudo a mi comunidad ensenando sobre las herramientas con las cuales pueden llevar a cabo sus ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>y sobre todo estoy haciendo lo que mas me apaciona y es hacer del mundo un lugar mejor una linea de codigo a la vez.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/making-the-world-a-better-place-one-line-of-code-at-a-time/\">Making The World A Better Place One Line Of Code At A Time</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Alfredo Navas\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"Do The Woo Community: Don’t Put Technical Support in the Wrong Box\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=73116\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://dothewoo.io/dont-put-technical-support-in-the-wrong-box/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:398:\"<p>Your technical support team is an extension of the customer service department and of the sales department.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/dont-put-technical-support-in-the-wrong-box/\">Don&#8217;t Put Technical Support in the Wrong Box</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 09:51:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"WPTavern: 10up Publishes Gutenberg Best Practices Website\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=138755\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wptavern.com/10up-publishes-gutenberg-best-practices-website\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2819:\"<p>10up has published a <a href=\"https://gutenberg.10up.com/\">Gutenberg Best Practices</a> website as a public resource with tutorials, documentation, and example code. Maintaining current documentation has not been a strong point of the official Gutenberg project as the pace of the project makes it difficult for contributors and extenders to keep up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg introduced an entirely new editorial paradigm for content creation and page building within WordPress,&#8221; 10up Associate Director of Editorial Engineering Fabian Kaegy said. &#8220;Because the block editor is still fairly new, it is advancing quickly and changes are introduced regularly; as such, learning opportunities are scarce and we have felt an absence of best practice documentation that meets 10up standards for craftsmanship.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>10up&#8217;s Gutenberg Best Practices were written to supplement WordPress&#8217; core documentation with what Kaegy said is a &#8220;more client-services-centric approach tailored to engineering enterprise-level editorial experiences.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For developers who are brand new to working with the block editor, the <a href=\"https://gutenberg.10up.com/reference/\">Reference</a> section has a wealth of information about the anatomy of a block, the fundamentals of block theming with theme.json, block extensions, block variations, and more, with supporting videos and gifs. The documentation also gives a little more context for practical usage. For example, the section about <a href=\"https://gutenberg.10up.com/reference/Blocks/block-transforms\">Block Transforms</a> includes information about when and how to define block transforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Training section of 10up&#8217;s Gutenberg Best Practices contains a mini crash course on the file structure of a block and all of its components, and how to build a custom block using the <a href=\"https://github.com/10up/wp-scaffold/tree/trunk/themes/10up-theme/includes/blocks/example-block\">10up Starter Block</a>. This is especially helpful for developers looking for some extra guidance developing their first blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://gutenberg.10up.com/guides/\">Guides</a> section contains more advanced topics like extending core blocks and including frontend JS with a block. The documentation is <a href=\"https://github.com/10up/gutenberg-best-practices\">available on GitHub</a> for anyone to contribute edits. The site also links to a <a href=\"https://github.com/10up/gutenberg-best-practices/discussions\">discussion board on GitHub</a> where developers are welcome to join discussions and workshop the best practices in collaboration with 10up employees. 10up has published the Gutenberg Best Practices website with a beta designation and intends to update and expand it as WordPress evolves.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 21:46:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 6.1 Release Candidate 2 (RC2) Now Available\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13646\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/10/wordpress-6-1-release-candidate-2-now-available/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6966:\"<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The second release candidate (RC2) for WordPress 6.1 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>“Release Candidate” means that this version of WordPress is ready for release and it is a key milestone in the 6.1 release cycle!

Previously, users could share an unlimited number of posts automatically via their connected social media accounts. Jetpack is shuffling its monetization strategy for this extension and has capped social sharing at 30 shares per month for the free tier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/social/\">new paid plan</a> offers 1,000 shares and re-shares per month, starting at $1/month for the first month and is $10/month thereafter. As a concession, Jetpack is rolling the social previews and re-sharing into the free plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>With Jetpack Social, if a post is automatically shared to Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, that counts as three shares. It&#8217;s easy to see how quickly these shares can rack up to where even a casual blogger might require a paid plan. Publishers that are used to being able to automatically share all their posts for free should be aware this change that limits them to to 30 shares per month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would not be surprised to see some users switch to another social sharing plugin, as many others offer far more social networks and don&#8217;t limit the number of times users can share. Instead they opt to restrict re-sharing, scheduling, or the ability to connect multiple accounts per social network. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jetpack Social has a new team behind it focused on making the product better. In 2021, Automattic <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-social-image-generator-plugin-plans-to-integrate-with-jetpack\">acquired the Social Image Generator plugin</a> with plans to integrate it into Jetpack&#8217;s social media tools. This may make the product more compelling, since it currently doesn&#8217;t stand up well to the myriad of free sharing plugins out there. Jetpack only supports four social networks, but the team is working on expanding the plugin&#8217;s capabilities. The plugin&#8217;s development team also <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%5BType%5D+Feature&template=feature-request.yml&title=Feature+Request%3A\">accepts feature suggestions</a> on its GitHub repository.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 1.4.0 of the Jetpack Social plugin moved the share limits code to the Publicize package and added a meter to show users how many shares they have remaining. Users on the free plan should notice these changes in their dashboards.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 14:54:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"Do The Woo Community: A WooSesh Chat with Paul Maiorana, Kimberly Coleman and Courtney Robertson\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=73148\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"https://dothewoo.io/woosesh-chat-paul-maiorana-kimberly-coleman-courtney-robertson/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:454:\"<p>In this show we talk about the new turnkey WooCommerce, flash sales year round and a look at the first day of sessions. </p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/woosesh-chat-paul-maiorana-kimberly-coleman-courtney-robertson/\">A WooSesh Chat with Paul Maiorana, Kimberly Coleman and Courtney Robertson</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 10:15:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"WPTavern: Plugin Dependencies Feature Plugin Now Ready for Testing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=138684\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://wptavern.com/plugin-dependencies-feature-plugin-now-ready-for-testing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3427:\"<p>For more than a decade, WordPress developers have been <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/yet-another-plugin-dependencies-discussion-two-proposals-this-time\">discussing</a> how core can support plugins that require one or more other plugins in order to work. Having a standardized way of managing plugin dependencies would be a useful and time-saving feature for developers, who currently have to roll their own solutions for this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The situation there is a lot like the relationship between parent and child themes,&#8221; project lead Andy Fragen said in February when <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/02/24/feature-project-plugin-dependencies/\">introducing the idea for the feature plugin</a>. &#8220;Without their relationships to the bigger plugin, those dependent plugins can do very little. Every plugin developer is on their own to code a solution to resolve the issue. The single most common example is WooCommerce, which is a dependency for hundreds, if not thousands, of WooCommerce add-on plugins.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After nine months of discussion and development, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-plugin-dependencies/\">Plugin Dependencies feature plugin</a> is now <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/12/call-for-testing-plugin-dependencies/\">ready for testing</a>. It allows plugin authors to specify any WordPress.org-hosted plugin(s) that are required for their plugins to function. A plugin that has dependencies can be identified by adding a “Requires Plugins” header to the docblock of the main plugin file. Plugin authors can specify as many dependencies as necessary in a comma-separated list of plugin slugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How does it work? Site owners will get an admin notice if there are dependencies they need to install. The plugin card will be updated to display the <em>Requires</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Required by</em>&nbsp;information on the Plugins screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Fragen <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/12/call-for-testing-plugin-dependencies/\">outlined</a> how the community can test the new core support for handling plugin dependencies. You do not have to be a developer to participate in testing this new feature. It involves installing test plugin files and confirming admin notices appear and disappear at the right times. Testers who are comfortable editing plugin files can try adding dependencies, adding a dependency for non-WordPress.org plugins, and other more advanced tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Version control is not part of this project, so developers will not be able to specify a minimum required version, for example. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Version control&nbsp;is out of scope for the feature as described in the original Make post referenced above,&#8221; Fragen said in response to a question on the feature plugin. &#8220;As the majority of the dependencies come from the dot org repository, the most current versions will be installed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Specifically, WordPress should automatically prompt the user to update to the current version and may use auto-updates as well.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing will be open until December 1, 2022.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And today I have with me Nick Diego. Welcome, Nick, to the WordPress Briefing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:00:44]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you so much for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:46]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Before we get started, why don&#8217;t you tell me a bit about yourself, just kind of your history with WordPress and then what it is that you&#8217;ve been doing with the WordPress 6.1 release squad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:00:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so I&#8217;m actually kind of new to working with WordPress full-time. Up until about June of last year, I was in the hospitality industry for a career of 10 years. But I always loved doing WordPress on the side. And after the long pandemic, I figured it was time to kind of pursue my passion and work with WordPress full-time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that ultimately led to my current role as a developer advocate at WPEngine, where I focus primarily on WordPress and contribution to Core itself. And then I guess it was maybe March or April this year when <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/annezazu/\">Anne McCarthy</a>, who I&#8217;ve worked with a ton, she asked me if I&#8217;d be interested in helping out on 6.0 as an Editor Triage Lead which was an awesome experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now I&#8217;m back for 6.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:37]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s excellent. I always like to hear about people who are coming to do repeat tours of duty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:01:43]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:44]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I probably shouldn&#8217;t refer to working on WordPress releases as a tour of duty. However, I find that releases are so large and complex, and there are so many people in there now that working on them takes an entirely different skill set now than it used to take when WordPress was like 1% of the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think it&#8217;s a really big task, and I think it&#8217;s great when people were, like, that was either so good that I would do it again, or I would like a second go because I could do it better. Whichever way brings people to it. So, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:02:18]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, I was just gonna say that&#8217;s a great point because the Editor Triage Lead, which is the role that I currently have, was a brand new role for 6.0. The project kind of got so big that it kind of made sense to have a triage lead focused specifically on Gutenberg. Gutenberg&#8217;s such a big part of WordPress now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that&#8217;s where that role kind of came from, and now we&#8217;ve carried it over to 6.1. As the project grows, we need more people to come in and help make sure the release is as smooth as it can be.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Because of that promise of backward compatibility and all the things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:02:47]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:48]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cool. So, by the time this releases, if I recall correctly, we will have passed RC2, or RC2 is coming the next day or something like that. We&#8217;re right around the Release Candidate two. So you have been doing this for quite some time on this particular release. So far, what is the feature that you&#8217;re most excited about that&#8217;s going out in the 6.1 release?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:03:09]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, this is going to sound really boring, but it&#8217;s actually incredibly exciting. So, the most exciting quote-unquote feature that I&#8217;m excited about is the improved consistency and standardization of block controls that are coming in 6.1. So things like typography and color and borders and dimensions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are things and tools that we&#8217;ve had in a lot of core blocks, but it hasn&#8217;t been consistent throughout. And a ton of work has been done in 6.1 to establish that consistency. We&#8217;re not a hundred percent there, but typography, I think we&#8217;re at like 85% of all core blocks now support all the typography controls, and with each release as we head to 6.2, we&#8217;ll improve on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s really great for theme builders, theme designers, and users to be able to control the look and feel blocks consistently throughout the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:58]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was gonna immediately answer you earlier with like, there are no boring answers, there are no boring improvements. And as you were explaining why it is that you kind of thought it might be considered boring, I think it&#8217;s fair to say that anytime that you&#8217;re increasing the consistency and you&#8217;re increasing the confidence between what you saw on the back end and what you actually shipped on the front end– anytime you&#8217;re doing that, I think that that is exciting in the prove the negative way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think about the negative excitement that occurs when you have published something, and it looks one way in the back end, and then it looks totally different on the front end, and the panic you feel when you have to fix. Not having that is a really big step up, I think. And so anything that provides more consistency for people who are using WordPress, people who are building with WordPress, I always find exciting. But also, like, I&#8217;m an office person, and so I would find office things exciting, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:04:53]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It creates a more delightful experience. I do a lot of work on the Training team, doing educational things, and we teach people how to change typography and change color. Once they learn how to do it in one block, if they can take that same skill set and apply it to any other block, it&#8217;s that light bulb moment. They understand they know how to manipulate and use WordPress to its fullest. So adding that consistency really helps to level up users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:15]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m gonna take us off track a little bit and just ask a general question here. Like, I remember the first time that I was working with what was a site, I guess, qualified for a site at the time. And I remember the first time that I discovered that I could change the look and feel with HTML and CSS, and I did that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also was like, well, I accept my fate. Whatever happens, if I kill everything I&#8217;ve ever written, that is just how it&#8217;ll be. Like the sheer terror of all of that is so different now. Do you recall that first moment where you&#8217;re like, Oh, I do have some power over this? I have some control over this, and whether you also found it scary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:05:52]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I came to WordPress kinda as a hobby and website development kind of as a hobby. So I was kind of always in that tinkering phase, or I wasn&#8217;t building something for anyone else. I was in a safe place to destroy whatever I was working on with my tinkering. So I never really quite had that fear, but I can definitely see it from the perspective of building something for somebody else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you&#8217;re right, the editor and the controls that we have, and you know, now make it a lot easier to kind of manipulate and exert your creative desires in WordPress than it was before with CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:23]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love the phrase ‘I was safe to destroy things, ’ and if I can figure out a way to make it a tagline for something, I will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:06:30]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:31]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright. So during your second time around here on the release squad with 6.1, what have been the bright spots of that experience, and have there been any unexpected challenges of being on the release squad?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:06:44]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, I come to WordPress from, you know, from a different career. It&#8217;s kind of a passion of mine to be working with WordPress. So I kinda have a unique experience than maybe some others. And when I approach WordPress, there&#8217;s always that tendency to say, ‘why doesn&#8217;t it do this?’ Or ‘why don&#8217;t they do this?’ And I&#8217;ve always been the person…, well, it&#8217;s open source. We, we, we can, we can</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>…can do it</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:07:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>…we can do it. And so that&#8217;s kind of how I approach things. Now, of course, you know, I have the privilege of time to do that. Not everybody does, but one of the unexpected bright spots about working in a release squad is understanding how it all works.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How does WordPress actually get built? What is the process that it goes through? It was just eye-opening to me, and I really got a shout-out, Anne, for inviting me to be on 6.0. It brought me in. I learned so much about it, and now I&#8217;m just excited to keep working on these releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a release is hard. You know, it&#8217;s a… WordPress is huge. There are a lot of moving parts, there are a lot of things going on. Right now, we&#8217;re trying to get everything ready for the first release candidate. So being on the release squad is not an easy job. But it&#8217;s exciting, it&#8217;s fun, and you really feel like you&#8217;re part of that ‘we’ really helping to build WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:53]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that I hope that people have learned from any time that they spent working with me is that like we understand here in the WordPress open source project, and I believe that all open source projects must understand this, but like every change that you make, if there are things that are dependent on it, which is gonna be true for most of us, we&#8217;ll have intended consequences and also unexpected consequences, and unintended, unexpected consequences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I&#8217;ve always felt like the thing that really makes the biggest difference about how we do open source in WordPress is that, for the most part, we have a concept of where the most likely changes are going to happen across our entire ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a better understanding, at least compared to when I got here, a better understanding of how interconnected it all is. And so you&#8217;ve got this change here, and it looks small, but it&#8217;s gonna have this positive or negative impact as you kind of work your way out from it. And so I think that that is an interesting thing, and certainly, you get a really clear concept of it in the release squad, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:09:02]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, absolutely. If you were to build something like the block editor without caring at all about backward compatibility, you&#8217;d be done by now, right? I mean, so much of what we do is concerning ourselves with making sure that everybody who&#8217;s on a classic theme or hybrid theme or whatever it might be that they continue to use WordPress in a safe and stable way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is part of being such a large content management system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you already told us the feature that you&#8217;re most excited about, and so now I&#8217;m gonna ask you about what feature or what bug fix has the most notable improvements that are coming to 6.1. This is a little different as in, like, there&#8217;s the thing you&#8217;re excited about, which is an office thing, but like a thing that is maybe not new but has the biggest delta, the biggest change to anyone&#8217;s experience of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:09:51]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so obviously, in 5.9, we introduced full site editing, and 6.0 was a natural progression from that with more and more features. Now it&#8217;s safe to say that there&#8217;s only a small fraction of websites that are using the whole full site editing of or block themes, all that kind of stuff. One of the hangups about that was managing templates inside of the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could add the files to your theme, which would then show up in the site editor. But there wasn&#8217;t a direct way to add more complicated templates within the site editor itself. That is changing in 6.1. So now you actually have the functionality to install something like 2023, which is the new core theme, and build out all these very complicated templates within the UI of the site editor that you could not have done before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:10:38]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I personally think that the biggest benefit of full site editing is really to empower no-code or low-code users. And the ability to add these templates directly in the UI really levels them up. Because now, you can do all that complicated stuff that you normally would need to be adding to theme files and jumping into the code. You can do that within the site editor now, which I think is fantastic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:59]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s great. And just a general caveat, anytime that we talk about anything that&#8217;s very developer-y or very no code-y, I think it&#8217;s always worth mentioning, yes, a lot of what we&#8217;re trying to do with the block editor is to just kind of give some power back to folks who cannot find the time to become a developer or don&#8217;t have the inclination. They don&#8217;t want to do that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that does not mean that no code is ever involved in WordPress. It&#8217;s still a software. You can still do very complicated things with it. And if you are a developer, you should not think to yourself, ‘oh now that it&#8217;s being available to low code/no code users, that means you don&#8217;t want me.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, that&#8217;s not at all what&#8217;s happening. You can do very complicated things still.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:11:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A hundred percent. A hundred percent. Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:45]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, so that brings us to our final question here because we like to stay as true to the name as possible here on the WP Briefing. If someone were wanting to get involved with the next release, so WP 6.2, how would they do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:12:01]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, talk to Anne, and she&#8217;ll get you set up. No, I&#8217;m just kidding. So at the, after each release, there&#8217;s a posting that goes out that lists all the different release teams, and you can just put your name out there and ask to be, you know, for consideration to be part of the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I will say that the best thing you can do right now is help with 6.1. You don&#8217;t necessarily need to be a release lead to do that testing, helping with bug fixes. Reach out to me. Reach out to other release leads, and we&#8217;ll get you involved and engaged with the release. That will give you a really good framework to start working and become a release lead for 6.2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:12:37]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I think we talked maybe two or three episodes ago, or it could be more than that, I&#8217;ll never know, about the release squad, like the group that&#8217;s doing that. In the event you think to yourself, ‘there&#8217;s no way in a million years that I&#8217;m gonna just show up tomorrow and be part of the release squad,’ I heard what they said in the first question/answer moment– that&#8217;s fine, too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Nick mentioned, you can always get involved with testing, you can get involved with triage. Those are areas where any feedback at all is valuable because we can get better information about what worked and didn&#8217;t, what was expected versus what happened. And that type of information is where all of our co-creators of the WordPress software–really, we rely on what you all are pointing out to us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re not shining spotlights on the most painful parts of your experience, sometimes we don&#8217;t necessarily know that that&#8217;s a pain point for anyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:13:34]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so yeah, that&#8217;s a great place to start. If you are more of a writer, technical or prose, there are different spaces you can go to, like keep our docs up to date or make sure that people know that changes are coming at all in WordPress because that&#8217;s a thing. If you are a backend developer, we have a million things you can do because that&#8217;s just all day, every day, for WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s just all the deep backend work. And so yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:13:58]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did want to mention that, you know, being on the release team does not necessarily mean that you&#8217;re incredibly technical. We have a documentation lead, we have a design lead, you know, a communication lead. So there&#8217;s a lot of different roles in the team that, you know, across all disciplines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So don&#8217;t think if you&#8217;re not a hardcore developer, that precludes you from being on the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:19]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and if you&#8217;re really good with common sense and working fully remotely, you can be the release coordinator. I can tell you because I did that for 5.0. It was a big job. It was our, it was the first time we had a release squad as opposed to just like the release lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because there was just so much that was going into that and so much riding on it. And like you said in some other answer that you gave like if you were to just be like, we&#8217;re shutting everything down and rewriting this in six months, and I hope you can come with us on it. Like a lot of open source projects do it that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:51]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is a choice, and we made the opposite choice. And so we&#8217;re bringing all of our co-conspirators with us, all of our co-creators of WordPress. That&#8217;s the hope all the time. Making sure that they have enough information, that they feel safe to destroy things, enough information, and skills about how to get out of it, that they always feel some high confidence in what they&#8217;re trying to do versus what they actually did do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, excellent. Nick, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:15:20]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nope. I just hope everybody goes out and downloads 6.1 and enjoys it as much as I am.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:25]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, go check it out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. And actually, it is a pretty big list today, but still pretty big things too. So first up, we have a call for testing that is out, and it is for our Android users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a call for testing for WordPress for Android 20.9, and I feel like we don&#8217;t get a lot of calls for testing for Android devices. And so if you have been feeling left out or just like we don&#8217;t always have that kind of mobile testing available, this is the opportunity for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing is that tomorrow, we have RC2, release candidate two for WordPress 6.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s coming out on October 18th. There will be a link in the show notes, but that means if you write a plugin or a theme or have anything that kind of extends the core of WordPress, now is the time to start testing anything that might be a bug or represent a breaking change and make sure that you file those bugs so that we can get things as settled and excellent as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:16:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of Word points, uh, WordPress 6.1, not Word point, WordPress 6.1. I actually have three changes that I think are going to represent some pretty big changes for folks. I will have links to all of these in the show notes. If you don&#8217;t know where the show notes are, it&#8217;s on wordpress.org/news/podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the three things that I think are gonna be big, worthwhile things. The first one is multisite improvements, and the second one will be the style engine that&#8217;s block styles generation tool, which will ship in Core and I think is really important for y&#8217;all to take a look at. And then also there are some changes coming to the block editor preferences.<br /><br />Like I said, links to all of those are going to be in the show notes, and so they should be pretty easy for you to find. But also, if you want to just get a general look at everything that&#8217;s coming in 6.1, we did a walkthrough that I will link to in the show notes as well, and you can get a full understanding of what is going to be coming early in November.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:17:45]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list –big list– of big things. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing.

Many content creators have waited for this for years: Now the block editor will actually remember your setting to switch on the Top Toolbar, and switch off the Full-screen view, and switch off the Welcome screen. Now it&#8217;s all stored in the database of your sites. It does not save it across multiple sites, though. WordPress is powerful but not that powerful. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Developer are now empowered <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/extending-the-query-loop-block/\"><strong>extending the Query Loop block</strong></a>.

Wrigley wrote: &#8220;It’s becoming easier to create the blocks, as the tools take away much of the technical burden of getting you up and running without advanced knowledge of JavaScript and React. Coupled with core components, native block supports, and a bit of guidance, Nick thinks that every WordPress developer can add custom blocks to their repertoire.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brian Coords</strong> discovered the <a href=\"https://www.briancoords.com/wordpress-secret-world-of-javascript/\"><strong>WordPress’ Secret World of JavaScript</strong></a>, when taking the new Course on <em>Learn.WordPress</em> <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/course/using-the-wordpress-data-layer/\">Using the WordPress Data Layer</a>. Coords also marveled on the fact that all the great tools available to allow developers to build on basis of WordPress outside the block editor for instance on settings pages of a plugin or on supplement admin pages and not many are using them (yet). </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cameron Jones</strong> also shared his experience developing around the block editor and found: <a href=\"https://cameronjonesweb.com.au/blog/adding-a-custom-icon-to-the-social-links-block-should-not-be-this-hard/\"><strong>Adding A Custom Icon To The Social Links Block Should Not Be This Hard</strong></a>. His task was to add another service and icon to the core&#8217;s Social Block. Jones takes us along his journey of figuring out how to accomplish this task. There were a few U-turns and cul-de-sac moments on the way. I found it quite an interesting read, as it elaborated on the gaps that need to be closed for the Gutenberg project to be more attractive to extenders in the future. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to believe Jones, it was not missing documentation. &#8220;And to my pleasant surprise, the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-variations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">official documentation</a> was quite good in this regard.&#8221; he wrote. And after going through all the up and downs of learning new things, Jones concluded: <em>&#8220;The provision of the <code>@wordpress/scripts</code> package and much improved documentation makes me feel far more confident in starting to approach development for the block editor again.&#8221;</em> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, I have to agree with Jones: it shouldn&#8217;t be so hard to add another block variations to a block that mostly sports block variations out of the box. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>In his tutorial <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/rendering-external-api-data-in-wordpress-blocks-on-the-front-end/\"><strong>Rendering External API Data in WordPress Blocks on the Front End</strong></a>, <strong>Manoj Kumar</strong> shows you how to build a dynamic block that fetches data from an external API and renders it on the frontend when a particular block is dropped into the Block Editor of a post.

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about Gutenberg 14.2 and 14.3 plugin releases, WordPress 6.1 release candidate, style variations in the theme directory as a beta, a developer course on Gutenberg data layer, and so much more. I&#8217;m Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and WordPress developer advocate. And my guest today is Dave Smith, a JavaScript engineer and full-time core contributor on the Gutenberg project, sponsored by Automattic. Good afternoon, Dave. Thanks for joining me today. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Hi, Birgit. Yeah, I&#8217;m doing really well, thank you. And it&#8217;s great to be able to join you on the show again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, although you have been a guest on the Change Log before we always get new listeners. And so maybe you could tell us briefly about yourself and what you are working on at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, sure. I&#8217;m a developer living from and working in England in the United Kingdom. And as you mentioned before, I&#8217;m sponsored by Automattic and I work full-time on the Gutenberg Project. So my primary focus tends to be the navigation project, which I&#8217;ve been on for the 6.1 cycle, and that&#8217;s now encompassing all aspects of managing navigation in the editor, including the nav block. I also run a YouTube channel, which is Dave on WP, where I post regular videos on all aspects of the block editor. And most recently I&#8217;ve been working on an overview video for all the key features coming to WordPress 6.1, so if anyone would like to check that out, then they can have a look at the channel, which is youtube.com/c/daveonwp, and I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll have that link in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, of course we do put a link in the show notes. Yeah, and I found great videos about the work on the navigation block there. They were very helpful getting into the problem space and why it&#8217;s all so difficult to solve. So thanks for putting them together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: No problem, yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Oh, there was also another video, I watched your presentation that you gave to an agency team that is starting out adopting the block editor for their work, and they had some interesting questions for you. So what was your takeaway from the discussions with the group?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, so that was the discussion I had with Corner Shop Creative, I believe. Yeah, they were brilliant, they were such a great team. They had loads of questions, I think the Q&amp;A ended up being longer than the actual presentation itself, actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s a good thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yes, it was a good thing. I always think it&#8217;s a good sign. But that team had, they really fully embraced the block editor, but they&#8217;re butting up against some of the same problems we hear a lot about, styling and curation of content. An example that came up was this possibility of having a synced block pattern, which could be updated with styling changes after the fact. As you know, once you insert a pattern, it&#8217;s a one time action. Once it&#8217;s done, it&#8217;s done. You can&#8217;t go back and then update it. So every time the client wants to update their styles, they have to go through all of the instances of the pattern and update them so you that you can see how that&#8217;d be a bit of a headache.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I don&#8217;t see any really good way to deal with that yet apart from inheriting all the styles from global styles instead of applying bespoke ones to the pattern itself. But it&#8217;s certainly a tricky problem anyway, it illustrates that we still have some ways to go to solve all these real world use cases that folks are running up against.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, updating prior work was actually a pain point that I also heard at WordCamp Europe as well as WordCamp US, where it&#8217;s not only the pattern but it&#8217;s also when you have a theme that was modified, the template was modified, when the theme is updated through a theme shop, the user doesn&#8217;t get the new templates because they override it through their user stuff. That also a good problem to solve because if they update the template and. although it was changed by the user, they&#8217;re not getting the new features in there, whatever that&#8217;s in there. So it&#8217;s kind of a tricky bit there. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, you mentioned it, let&#8217;s discuss WordPress 6.1 release cycle for a bit before we head into the Gutenberg plugin releases. Do you want to start out with that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, absolutely. So I think we&#8217;ve had the RC1 on the 11th of October, 2022. We&#8217;re recording on the 14th, I think, today. So yeah, it&#8217;s time to perform those final reviews and get testing on that. As usual, we don&#8217;t recommend running this on a production or mission critical website, I think we all know that by now, but just in case. And we&#8217;ve got the final release of this 6.1 is going to be out on the 1st of November, 2022, all being well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, there&#8217;s some people who say, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not going to update until 6.1.1 is out,&#8221; but yeah, I hear there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, well, I mean there&#8217;s absolutely loads of changes in this release. I think there&#8217;s some stat of 1,700 PRs merged or something like that, so there&#8217;s absolutely a load of features coming down the line. But also bug fixes and tooling and testing changes, I think it&#8217;s going to be a really strong release. Do you agree?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah, I agree. Yeah, there are countless changes for the content creators, and we talked about those in the last six or seven episodes when we discuss the Gutenberg plugin releases. But so almost all features from the plugin releases 13.1 through 14.1 will make it or made it into the WordPress 6.1. It&#8217;s already, as you said, in release candidate. So feature freeze was beta one, release candidate one is actually string free. So the army of polyglot contributors that translate all the new things coming to WordPress between now and the final release can be sure that they don&#8217;t have to do it again when there are additional string changes there. So that&#8217;s string free. So it&#8217;s pretty clear.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are two or three things that didn&#8217;t make it in there as I discovered, there was a zoom out window, the table of contents block is not in 6.1, and also the theme support for the appearance tool for classic themes that didn&#8217;t make it into 6.1. They need some more testing or some more refinement before it goes out to millions of users. And I just realized that 6.0, WordPress 6.0, was already downloaded a hundred million times.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Wow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So the counter resets in about a month&#8230; No, about two weeks, for 6.1, but then we know the final number. So the field guide for WordPress 6.1 has been published and I counted 19 developer notes about the block editor and block based themes, that&#8217;s double the amount of developer notes for 6.0. There&#8217;s also a separate field guide for performance update from the performance team. Awesome work there. And also a separate post that lists all the accessibility changes coming to WordPress 6.1 by Anne McCarthy, and I think she lists about 50 different changes that were coming. So Dave, what are the features that you are most excited about this release?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Oh, there&#8217;s so much. I&#8217;ve just been going through all these changes for WordPress 6.1 actually, and there&#8217;s just so many great things. But I think probably the biggest thing that I think people will notice when they download 6.1 for the first time is just how many more design tools are available across the blocks in 6.1. There&#8217;s been a big push throughout the 6.1 cycle to roll out all the standardized tools for blocks for things like color, typography, layout, spacing, and that kind of thing. And I think now that&#8217;s really coming to fruition. I think we&#8217;re only 50% of the way through all the blocks apparently, I read the last ticket, but it&#8217;s surprising what a difference that makes compared to 6.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. And I actually put, I&#8217;m so excited about it, I put a table together with all the core blocks and so you can see all the core blocks and then typography, color controls, dimension controls, border controls, and layer controls, and then you see which block has what. So that&#8217;s in the dev nodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Oh, that sounds brilliant. Yeah, I&#8217;ll have to look that up. Yeah, well the other thing I wanted to have to talk about was the&#8230; Something that I think will help increase adoption rates for block editing, and that&#8217;s the ability to utilize and edit template parts in classic themes. And first time I heard it I thought, &#8220;Oh, what&#8217;s the point of that? It sounds a bit strange.&#8221; But actually I found that it affords a lot of power, because what it enables you to do is things like make your header or your footer fully editable whilst not requiring our users to have to fully deal with and embrace the full site editor experience. So I was testing this out and I had to go at converting the 2020 theme to allow me to be able to edit the footer. And it was so easy to do, but yet it opened up such an amazing thing because normally if you want to edit just something as simple as the text and the footer, you&#8217;d have to create an option and create a new setting in your theme and do all that sort of thing. And now you can just go in and at the footer text, click save, and it&#8217;s done. And so actually I think it&#8217;s a bigger win than you might expect when you hear that for the first time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. And Justin Tadlock actually did a little tutorial when he did the same thing that you did. I think he converted the 20&#8230; No, he converted the 2021 with some block parts and had a hero image of the header and all that. So that is actually published several weeks ago at the Gutenberg Times website. So I will add that link also to the show notes. But it goes really through the whole problems that he encountered also with CSS, because sometimes you need to update the things and that&#8217;s expected, but also how little there was to update. And he also added a few patterns to it and how you can do that. So that&#8217;s a great tutorial if you want to check that out. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Absolutely. Justin&#8217;s articles are always really good, isn&#8217;t it? So I&#8217;ll definitely be looking at that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: There&#8217;s one more thing actually you want to call out, if I may.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, sure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: And this one, I think, has flown slightly under the radar on this release, but it&#8217;s actually the syncing of editor preferences across devices. So I mean you&#8217;ll be familiar that you can do things like set the persistent list view or you want top toolbar mode within the editor. But in 6.0 these rules just saved locally to the device you were on. So if you went and then switched to a new device, all those changes would be lost, you&#8217;d have to reapply those references, which is kind of annoying. So with 6.1, however, they&#8217;ve now updated it so the changes are saved to the database. So that means that they&#8217;re going to apply across all your devices. So if you&#8217;re at work and you set top toolbar mode at work, you come home, log onto your home laptop, and it&#8217;s going to be exactly the same there. So it&#8217;s a nice quality of life improvement then. And big shout out to Daniel Richards who really spearheaded all the work in that area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I think there will be a sigh of relief for millions of block editor users that have said, &#8220;Yeah, I know the welcome guide. Yeah, go away. Let me go on with my work.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Absolutely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s really a great. But I also feel that it&#8217;s the right time to actually implement that because now the full range of preference tools is actually known. And then also figure out, okay, how all these editor, being the site editor, being the post editor. Yeah, how they handle those preference tools before you&#8217;re actually put it persistently in a database. I think that&#8217;s a good&#8230; The local storage was a good solution for interim, but now that it&#8217;s in a database now plugins and others can actually also know about that and help them modify that. So for developers in 6.1, there are great improvements on the controls for theme JSON, of course the typography and border controls and color for links coming also there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the most important thing that I feel is the query loop block extensions that the developer can now create a block variation for the query loop block and define, with the attributes, the customization of the list of posts, custom post types, or pages. And so theme developers working on more complex sites will hopefully make good use of that. I think the ease of style variations for theme developers is also&#8230; You can use them for classic themes. No, we talked about that. Yeah, style variations for the block themes are definitely good, coming to 6.1. They were actually for 6.0 already there, the default theme has it. But the default theme now is actually a base theme and now has 10 variations built from the community that come with a default theme. So I&#8217;m really excited about that. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s a pretty amazing thing, that 2023 theme, I think something like 38 contributions and ended up being with 10 different variations. Amazing. A new way of generating default themes for WordPress. I think it really points to the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I&#8217;m not sure if you should just keep that default theme, kind of change the name to default theme and just add variations in every area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: There&#8217;s variations now. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And do a shout out to the community and say, &#8220;Okay, now it&#8217;s time to show us the best variations,&#8221; and then we add it to them theme or something like that. I also saw theme developers that submitted quite a few style variations, build a child theme, and submitted that to the repository with their style variations in it. So you get, even if the design team just selected 10 of them, you get to see even more style variations for it. So it&#8217;s definitely quite some creativity going on in the community about that. Which brings us to our community contributions section of the site. Dave, you brought some with us.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Community Contributions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, I found quite a few community contributions this week, actually. So the first one I want to chat is about is client side web assembly, WordPress with no server. It&#8217;s sort of a click bait-y title if I ever heard one. But this was a post on make blog by Adam Zielinski. And what it is is it is what it says on the tin, WordPress running completely in the browser with no web server whatsoever. And probably most of your listeners will be familiar with WordPress, traditionally you have a web server and your browser sends&#8230; When you click on something like posts, it&#8217;s going to send a request to that server and the server&#8217;s going to respond with the answer. But of course if something happens like you go offline, then you can&#8217;t reach the server anymore, and therefore your site doesn&#8217;t work. And that&#8217;s always how WordPress has worked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What Adam&#8217;s done is been very, very clever and he&#8217;s used the technology called web assembly, which is a low level assembly like language similar to C or C++ or whatever. And basically what he&#8217;s done is he&#8217;s taken the PHP that comprises the WordPress software, compiled it down to web assembly, packaged it up in a bundle, and then run it completely in the browser. Then any requests that go out that would normally go out to WordPress get trapped by a service worker and it get reroutes them to this in browser version of WordPress. Sounds all very, very clever and you think, &#8220;Oh well, great experiment,&#8221; but it&#8217;s actually got some real world opportunities there, I think. Especially around learning WordPress in the browser. I don&#8217;t know if you saw that post, Birgit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh yeah, I actually reviewed it and had some questions for Adam before he published it. And I also tested some of the things. So it&#8217;s really amazing and I can imagine the opportunities are probably endless, but definitely when you have tutorial type posts, you can add that to it and people can then, in real time, make some changes to the code that they&#8217;re just learning or just reading about and then see how it impacts a website without having to spin up their own local, without any build tools, without any downloading of Gutenberg or something like that to see that all happening. And so it&#8217;s a much faster way to learn and see how things working, instead of&#8230; And then figure out how you add it to your own code. Yeah, yeah, so really I hope&#8230; And I saw Adam in between announcing, I ran into some browser freezes and browser&#8230; Because the bundle, of course, is also pretty big. If you have downloaded WordPress before, it&#8217;s about four or five megabits. And if you load that in a browser and in your memory of your local system, yeah, you need some heavy lifting there. And if you do some more, it kind of poops out on you, so to speak. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I mean that&#8217;s definitely why I think this is a first sort of prototype. I know Adam and colleagues are looking for people to start contributing and trying to make this more practical in real word usage. So if anyone is interested in that, then the link to that post will be in the show notes for this episode. I&#8217;m also going to be diving into the topic a little bit greater detail with Adam on my YouTube channel, so if you&#8217;re interested in that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, right, yeah. Excellent, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: I&#8217;m sure you can see that video at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, looking forward to that, yeah. So another community contribution is actually that the Meta team just released a beta version of displaying style variation in the theme directory. There&#8217;s a track ticket that was opened by Carolina Nemark, a full site editing expert if you need one. And so you can browse examples with a 2022 theme. I put the link in there. So the developer Steve Dufresne commented on the ticket, so to turn on the feature add ?beta-style_variations to the URL. And then the URL gets updated when you browse themes. So you&#8217;ll need to re-add that string, however, for each theme page to reload.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what I really like is that it&#8217;s now an increase of interactivity on the theme directory to help site owners to decide which theme they want to take. And every time you click on the little style variation card underneath the screenshot, the screenshot actually changes into displaying that style variation on the screenshot. So it&#8217;s quite fascinating and I&#8217;ve spent quite some time browsing themes that already have style variations in there. So if you don&#8217;t see a style variation, probably the theme doesn&#8217;t have some, but you find the best way&#8230; I saw maybe six or seven themes in there, but of course I didn&#8217;t browse all 160 block themes anymore. But yeah, try it out. I put the link to the track ticket into the show notes, so you can also see the string that you need to add there and a link to the 2022 theme so you can see all the style variations without downloading it. Yeah, let me know what you think about it. Yeah, I&#8217;m totally stoked about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, sounds really good. Well, the more themes that are adding these style variations, the more we&#8217;re going to need to have stuff like that in the theme directory. Yeah, great to see that happening. One more thing, community contributions this week is a new course on Learn.WordPress, which is the official sort of tutorial site for WordPress. And this is a new course on WordPress data layer and specifically the Gutenberg data layer. So for those who don&#8217;t know, the data layer is used throughout the block editor to read and write data. So for example, if you need a list of posts or you want to create new post, edit a post, you&#8217;re going to need to use the data layer at some point. And really that means it&#8217;s essential learning if you want to make anything more than the most basic of blocks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is a full course which covers not only the basics of the data layer but also best practices and some more advanced usages. I know the author, again, it&#8217;s Adam Zielinski, who&#8217;s been prolific recently. And he&#8217;s extremely knowledgeable in this topic so I&#8217;m confident there&#8217;ll be a great investment for anyone who&#8217;s got the time to look at that course. And the link, again, is going to be in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s great for any developer who has ambition in that. Yeah, definitely requires an advanced JavaScript and req knowledge to get through that course.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, but not everybody is there yet. So very soon, hopefully in the upcoming weeks, there&#8217;s an introduction to block development course coming up. And it gets you from almost zero to block building a real life example, like a multi-column block when you have a text and then it kind of distributes itself over the multiple columns. So yeah, this is the Adam Zielinski fan show because Adam Zielinski also send in, I think, three dev notes on Monday that we were able to put in the field guide. So there&#8217;s definitely some great work for developers in the works or in the 6.1.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Released</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right, so that brings us to the Gutenberg plugin releases 14.2 and 14.3. Let&#8217;s start with 14.2, release lead was Michal Czaplinski, who also published a release post on Make Blog, and of course another show note link. It entailed about 80 PRs, 15 enhancements, 24 bug fixes amongst them. And some of them even made it into the release candidate 6.1 that were back ported to the core. It&#8217;s a fairly small release now compared to the last two releases. I remember 14.1 had over 383 PRs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s not quite that big.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That was quite epic. But of course there was a rush to get all the features in to make the feature freeze of beta one. And then nevertheless, there are great enhancements, made it into the plugin. And Dave, what are the key features that were merged in the plugin?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, so for 14.2 we had smarter pattern suggestions for the query loop block variations, we&#8217;ve got improvements to the writing flow, a more polished calendar block, new banners and footers, block pattern categories, and auto completion for links is now in all blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, that sounds terrific. So let&#8217;s discuss them one at a time. So there is also letter spacing for the global styles, so you can now, for the heading, and you can now put them in the theme JSON file to have not only letter spacing but also font family selection and the other typography, which is letter like height, case for the headings like sentence case or title case or no case at all. So that&#8217;s all for the headings. And I think the letter spacing didn&#8217;t make it into 6.1, the others you find in the headings. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: We&#8217;ve also got another PR, which is switching us to using numbers instead of T-shirt sizing for labels for spacing presets. So if you&#8217;re changing something like padding or margin, there&#8217;s a little slider and you can slide between small, medium, large, extra large. That was deemed to be too complex, potentially, and had some accessibility concerns, so they&#8217;ve reversed just numbers, so zero, one, two, three, four, five.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, okay. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: It&#8217;s simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s simpler, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And there is another quality of life change that made it into, and that is hiding the floating block UI when typing. It was always going away but it now also hides the insert, so there is no distraction coming up when you type on a paragraph block or in any other blocks for that matter. I think that&#8217;s really important because that&#8217;s one of the big concerns for writers, that there is so much distraction, especially when they start out, every time they move the mouse something appears and then there&#8217;s gone until they see what it was. And it&#8217;s kind of disconcerting sometimes for writers when they start out with the block editor. So I like that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The color block also got now color support in 14.2, and polish styles, which is nice because I think the color block&#8230; Calendar block, color block. Sorry, let&#8217;s do that again.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Can you say it again?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Calendar block got now color support and polish style. And I&#8217;m really happy that the calendar block got some more love now because I think that&#8217;s the first change since the beginning of the&#8230; Just the last five years since the calendar block actually made it into the block editor. So that&#8217;s just really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s nice to see. Under patterns we&#8217;ve also got new categories, as I mentioned, for banners and footers. The reason we&#8217;ve got those is because we&#8217;ve already got the headers category for patterns, but that was really intended for more global elements that might be at the top of your site. But unfortunately people were putting in things like what you might call a hero section, sort of a standout call out within the flow of the page, and that wasn&#8217;t really the right place to put it. So to disambiguate those, they&#8217;ve created a new pattern category called banners and you can put all your hero sections in there as you wish. There&#8217;s also another one called footers, I think that does what it says on the tin, it&#8217;s just complimentary to headers really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right. Yes. Yeah. And those are the perfect candidate for actually classic themes to use in their themes, is the headers and footers. But the pattern category is something, it&#8217;s a little bit different. But there are also template parts that go with that. And isn&#8217;t there a semantic recognizing that if there is somebody edits the footer or the header, they get the respective category of patterns for choices in the editor? So I think that was also a reason, definitely for the footer pattern category. So the footer template part can have their own patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yes, and to suggest the most appropriate pattern for you. Yeah, that sounds like a good reason for that change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Another change was a link auto completer that is enabled for the blocks. Is that the&#8230; Oh, right, right. We talked about that. That&#8217;s the bracket bracket auto completer where it shows you, you just put in bracket bracket in the paragraph and in the list block and now in all blocks and you get a choice of the latest published posts or pages that you have on your site. That&#8217;s a very fast way to do inner links on your site, which actually help you with SEO as well, but also keep your reader on the site. So this is a great tool to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s good to see that in all blocks now, not just the paragraph block. Especially with the new list and blocks having inner blocks, so that&#8217;s quite important there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And it was missing from the list block actually.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I used that quite a bit on the Gutenberg Times the list block where I have just a list of links and all of a sudden it didn&#8217;t work anymore. So guess what I did?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Oh, I can guess. So next up, we&#8217;re onto the block live section and there&#8217;s been quite a number of enhancements to blocks. The main one is the query loop block now suggests patterns based on the active variation. So for this one, imagine if you have a query loop block, you might register a variation for it for something like listing out a list of products from your products custom post type. But that variation itself can also register patterns. So you might have a pattern, which is the list layout, and then another pattern which is list products in the grid. So you&#8217;ve got those two patterns.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what happens now is when you insert your products list variation, it will suggest to you those two patterns that the variation is registered. So it&#8217;s surfacing the most appropriate pattern for your query loop variation. And that&#8217;s quite powerful for things like e-commerce sites and things like that. So you&#8217;re not getting loads and loads of patterns you have to pick from that are completely irrelevant to the type of query loop you are inserting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s one of the features that quite a few agencies really love because they can narrow down the customization that a user can do and be very strict in certain things, but give a little bit of freedom. That also pairs with the content locking features that come with 6.1. I know I&#8217;m jumping back and forth, but it all comes together in one thing, in that it will be the, it&#8217;s the site editor thing. Yeah. So yeah, there also it was a great writing flow, a fix for it. Now when you partial select between blocks there and now you can drag it again, which wasn&#8217;t possible before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, you had, when you were dragging from one across a number of blocks, it would have this strange effect where it would go back to showing you the first block you&#8217;d dragged. So if you had a sidebar open as you would drag in between the blocks, it would flash between the first block and then the multi-select, the first block, the multi-select. And now what happens is just when you start, you click on the first block you drag and the toolbar and everything around it stays based on the first block that you selected. It&#8217;s a small change you probably wouldn&#8217;t notice, but if you were doing a lot of multi-selection, especially with drag and click and drag, you would definitely notice it flickering back and forth. It was really, really distracting. So that&#8217;s just another nice quality of life improvement there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, thank you for pointing that out. Cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Another one was when you&#8217;re creating templates in the editor, under the template screen. Previously you could, accidentally, if you were a bit overzealous with your clicking, you might create a number of templates because you could just repeatedly click the create button for any of the templates. So yeah, people were ending up with five versions of the one template and just thinking, &#8220;Well, how did that happen? I only clicked once.&#8221; So yeah, we&#8217;ve fixed that so it&#8217;s not possible to do that anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s definitely a nice fix there because it&#8217;s disconcerting for anybody who has that. And then the last one for 14.2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yes, under testing we have&#8230; Under storybook. Now this is quite interesting, they&#8217;ve set up a new development aid which adds visual regression testing to the components in storybook. So components are like the low level UI components that we use to build the editor as a whole, not just blocks, but everything as a whole. And storybook showcases those in one place. And what they&#8217;ve done is they set up a visual dipping tool. So you run the test, it takes a screenshot of your component at a point in time, and then the next time you run the test it takes another screenshot and says, &#8220;Is this different to the previous one?&#8221; And if a certain threshold difference is passed, then it flags it up and says, &#8220;This test has failed,&#8221; and then a human comes along and looks at it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it caught my eye because I thought, &#8220;Wow, this could be something that we could extrapolate out to maybe other parts of the editor,&#8221; like actual blocks themselves. Because with the best rule in the world, you&#8217;re can have all sorts of end-to-end tests and unit tests and all sorts of things like that. But the end of the day a lot of things are visual changes that only a human can notice. So if we&#8217;ve got this extra step of automation picking up on these things, it might help. Currently this is only running locally, it&#8217;s not running on continuous integration on GitHub, but maybe in the future someone could take that and run with it and maybe it could help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s a really great idea. I think that is something that developers who learn how to work with a block editor definitely can use that in their local development into figuring out, &#8220;Okay, what changed now? Yeah, what did I do wrong?&#8221; In the debugging parts, they don&#8217;t need to look at the console first when they see something like that. And they build visual regression into their own components that are based on the storybook components. So we are at the end of the Gutenberg plugin version 14.2. What did Gutenberg 14.3 bring to us?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: So 14.3 we had release lead Aaron Robertshaw and he&#8217;s posted the what&#8217;s new in Gutenberg 14.3 post on Make Blog. And WP Tavern have also covered this in Gutenberg 14.3 improves image drag and drop. And those links will be in the show notes. Let&#8217;s take a look at the change log, what have we got first here, Birgit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, first up is the post author blog now includes an option to link actually to the author archive, and this is definitely something that was&#8230; It&#8217;s a small tweak and it was probably a good first issue, but it&#8217;s definitely helping a lot of sites that have multiple authors to use it in the templates. Because then you also can, so you have an author archive and then when you template that you can also, there was one change in one of the other plugins that you can actually add the description that comes from the user database about the buyers, put it on top. So you have the author, you have the description, and then the list of all the blocks that now you can do link to that page from each host when you add the post author block to the post template. It&#8217;s a lot of templates and blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Well, I can see that it&#8217;s a small change, but I think it&#8217;s pretty handy for sites that produce a lot of content. I suppose the Gutenberg Times in fact would be one example of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: The next change we&#8217;ve got is we&#8217;re now using the tools panel in global styles. The typography panel is quite complex, as we mentioned before, it&#8217;s got things like letter spacing, case, all sorts of things you can change on typography these days. What it&#8217;s doing is now bringing the global styles interface into line with the typography interface that appears in blocks. So if you need to reset all the changes that you&#8217;ve made to typography across the entire site, on like a heading block, it&#8217;s now really easy to do that through a standard interface, which is a nice win there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent. Yeah. And now the feature that was grabbing the attention of Sarah Gooding at the WP Tavern is to allow an image to drop into an empty paragraph block and to create an image block. I think I intuitively thought that was already possible, but maybe I just dragged it between blocks. So now you can, every time you just hit enter on at the end of one block, you can just drag your image into an empty paragraph and it adds it to the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, I expect there&#8217;s probably instances where container blocks have a paragraph block as the default, so now you can just plug an image into that. That&#8217;s probably why it helps a lot as well. So yeah, nice little enhancement there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s great. Especially for the cover block, and group block, I can see that, yeah. Yeah, the next one&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: The next one is improvements to the writing flow, we&#8217;re now implementing of standardized controls that feel quite natural when you compare them with other text editors. So you can now hold down the alt key and use the arrow keys to jump around in blocks of text. So an example given is if your cursor is towards the end of a long paragraph, you can press alt and up arrow to move straight back to the beginning of that paragraph. And similarly, alt down arrow will move you to the end of that block of text. And these are all small little tweaks to the writing flow, but it does allow you to move quickly around text and brings Gutenberg into line with many other normal text editors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I think this was very missed for those who use other text editors too, because it throws you when your shift or control and left arrow doesn&#8217;t get you to the beginning of the line and you need to use the mouse to get there. So yeah, I really love that writing flow improvement there. So the next one, it&#8217;s the WP HTML tag processor, I think you need to explain to me and our listeners what that actually does, Dave.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: I&#8217;ll give it a good go. Yes, this is a technical change, but one that is important for people who are working with dynamic blocks. So often dynamic blocks, the ones that use PHP to output the content to the front of the site, because they&#8217;ve got some sort of dynamic requirements and they have to list a post or grab your, I don&#8217;t know, post site logo or something like that. In fact, the site logo&#8217;s a good example because there&#8217;s an attribute to control whether the site logo should be a link or not. And if it isn&#8217;t going to be a link, then we need some way to strip out the anchor tag from the resulting html.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And before this processor was added, we had to do this with what&#8217;s called regular expressions, which are notoriously unreliable for parsing and modifying html. And this was happening across a number of blocks and the use cases were getting ever more complex, especially around things like using the post featured image in the mark of the cover block for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what we&#8217;ve done here is we&#8217;ve added this HTML tag processor, which is a very standardized way to walk through the HTML of a given block, and then allow you to make common modifications to it, such as adding or removing class names. Seems like a small thing, but actually unlocks many, many doors and greatly simplifies working with blocks. Not only for core blocks like cover, gallery, and heading, but of course third party blocks can also take advantage of this now and avoid having to write lots of regex, which of course no one likes doing as far as I&#8217;m aware.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;m really excited about that because it improves so much the developer experience for the block editor and it&#8217;s such a nice tool to be a little bit more secure about what you&#8217;re changing. And if something else is in there, does it screw up your edit or your plugin for instance, or the block? Yeah. So yeah, I&#8217;m really looking forward to the dev note for that, it won&#8217;t come until 6.2 and we don&#8217;t know yet what the planning is for next year, but I know that the leadership is working on all the things that come with 6.2, so we will soon have some information about that. But yes, this is definitely&#8230; Try it out, it&#8217;s in plugin 14.3, so the team definitely would need some feedback on that to see if it actually lives up to its expectation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And then we have some more changes in the block library and one is also for the image and the team fixed the crop area aspect ratio for when you rotate an image and you crop it, that it keeps the aspect ratio for it. So it&#8217;s a nice change and it keeps you a little bit more safe when you do cropping on your images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, absolutely. The next one is another fix and it is for link colors in some theme contexts, specifically 2022. There was an issue whereby if an ancestor of the navigation block set a link color, then it would override any text color set on the navigation block, which is really, really confusing because say you had a, I don&#8217;t know, a green link color set on an a parent root block and you had red text color set in your navigation, you&#8217;d be seeing the green color in the editor thinking, &#8220;Well, what&#8217;s happened?&#8221; You wouldn&#8217;t know where this color&#8217;s coming from. It ended up being a temporary patch has being put in to basically increase the specificity of the CSS. But in the longer term we&#8217;re looking to migrate the nav block to use standardized color controls, but it&#8217;s a lot more complex than you&#8217;d imagine. But yeah, if you&#8217;d been experiencing that problem in your theme, then you hopefully shouldn&#8217;t have that problem anymore as of 14.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And that problem was on both ends, editor and front end?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, good to fix, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah. And there&#8217;s a next one, which is to re-add styles that were removed from classic themes. Why would we remove styles from classic themes, you ask? Well, obviously it was an accident. Basically a lot of the core styles have been moved to theme JSONs so that we can pass them programmatically, but in doing so some of the styles for buttons were lost and no longer output, which meant that classic themes had blank buttons for a little bit. So now those are in a separate style sheet and buttons are back looking nice again for classic themes by default.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I&#8217;m just going through that, and yes, that had been ported back, I think to&#8230; I&#8217;m not sure, is that ported back to WordPress 6.1? It looks like it but I&#8217;m not sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: I assumed that it had, if not, I think it has&#8230; Yes, it has been back ported to 6.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s a good thing, yes. So 6.1 is not having some backwards compatibility issues with classic themes, so that&#8217;s definitely a good thing. And then there were quite a few code quality changes that updates some of the tooling and linking code. Linting is when&#8230; Oh, maybe you would explain it better than I do, Dave.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: It&#8217;s just programmatically checking your code for common formatting changes. So WordPress requires you to have a space around parentheses, for example, so it will automatically check those and fix them for you. That&#8217;s linting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And the reason behind removing lodash dependencies from some of the JavaScript, I think was performance reasons, right? That it increased performance when you don&#8217;t need to load lodash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, lodash is a fairly sizable library, so there&#8217;s an effort underway to completely remove that dependency, which should reduce the bundle size going to the editor, which is always a good thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah. Speaking of tools, there&#8217;s another&#8230; It&#8217;s not a tool thing. There was quite a few discussions around the experimental APIs that made it into the WordPress code base, but now there is&#8230; Adam Zielinski actually put a proposal together on how to limit that access and the first version of it is now available in the Gutenberg plugin. Do you have some more information behind that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, so experimental APIs were quite controversial because Gutenberg does need to iterate and move quite quickly compared to core, for example. And so they often introduce experimental APIs and they&#8217;re not guaranteed to be stable and might break at any time. But of course some of these APIs were ending up going into a core WordPress release because they hadn&#8217;t been stabilized at the point that WordPress was released. And that was understandably something that we didn&#8217;t want to happen because WordPress has a commitment to backwards compatibility, so you can&#8217;t really have experimental APIs going into a core release.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a middle ground had to be found between those two positions, one, that Gutenberg needs to iterate quickly, and number two, that core needs to not have breaking changes in it, which is entirely legitimate. So the way that this has been done now is from now on, if Gutenberg wants to expose experimental APIs views within its code base, it has to do so quite explicitly. You have to go through a number of quite laborious steps to do so, which is important. And number two, if you are a plugin developer and you choose to consume and experimental APIs, you also have to jump through a number of code hoops in order to do that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of which actually requires you to type in, manually, a string of text which says something to the effect of, &#8220;I know that using this experimental API will break my plugin on the next release,&#8221; or something along those lines. I mean, we laugh, but the point is that it is to educate people that if you do use this, it&#8217;s it is at your own risk. And I like to think this is quite a nice middle ground between the two positions and hopefully we&#8217;ll see it come to a fruition in the next couple of releases as the current experimental APIs are stabilized and all future ones have to go through this complex setup state in order to be exposed anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And it wouldn&#8217;t so much be hard if only the Gutenberg plugin, that it would use the experimental APIs. But I think because most plugin developers that adopted block development also looked at the source code of the plugin and learned how, &#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s see how the core developer do that.&#8221; And they used that experimental API in their own plugins for many, many years now. And now that&#8217;s really hard to deprecate. If just WordPress using it, it would be easier to deprecate that because nobody else uses it and everybody would know how to change that. But because they are not only the plug-ins that are in the repository, they are plugins that are done by freelancers and agencies for their sites that are third-party plugins that are not in the repo might be using it. So that backwards compatibility promise is really something that needs to&#8230; Though the experimental APIs cannot be deprecated without breaking those and it also cannot be it need, they actually should need to be documented if third-party use them. But the nature of experimental API is actually not documented and can disappear at any time. But that is not possible when they&#8217;re in WordPress core.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, so there is a solution coming out and I think there is a lot of&#8230; We talked about it before maybe with&#8230; I&#8217;m not quite sure. On the Change Log before when for 6.0 when there were, I don&#8217;t know, 280 experimental APIs that are merged at the core. Some of them are really only used for the Gutenberg plugin or the block editor, but some of them were actually used in the wider ecosystem. So speaking of JavaScript library, there&#8217;s the next feature is remove enzyme completely, and enzyme is a react testing library.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yes, that&#8217;s right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right. Yeah. But now react has created their own testing library, so that&#8217;s why it doesn&#8217;t have to be bundled anymore, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah. I mean, we would be using these two testing libraries on our components, one was enzyme and the other one is react testing library. And react testing library, which is built on top of react&#8217;s own library, has its own nicer encourages you to test things in a&#8230; More experiencing them how the user would interact with the component, so it encourages better accessibility practices, et cetera. So it made sense to standardize towards one. So finally, after lots of work by lots of contributors, enzyme has been removed. And now if you want to test your components, you should use react testing library.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. Yeah. And in the PR, there are also some code examples on how to do this for your own code, what you need to do in terms of taking out enzyme and using react library, so check out the PR 44494. And of course it&#8217;s on the change log for 14.3. So this concludes 14.3 and our Gutenberg plugin releases and we&#8217;ve come to the things that we discuss what&#8217;s still an active development, but what might come or will come to the Gutenberg plugin in the near future. Dave, you are part of the navigation project, almost exclusively, what is in store for the navigation project?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s in Active Development or Discussed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, absolutely. Well, we&#8217;ve just rounded off the 6.1 cycle, we&#8217;re moving into thinking about 6.2. And there&#8217;s been a number of priorities suggested on the navigation tracking issue, which we&#8217;ll put a link to in the show notes, about what we should focus on for the 6.2 cycle for navigation in the block editor, including the navigation block. The proposal is at the moment to put a specific focus on editing and managing menus within the editor itself. It sounds obvious, but previous 6.1 is focused more on importing menus and automatic fallback behavior. Whereas this one is we&#8217;re going to try and actually the editing and managing of menus themselves. So there&#8217;s that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re also going to be working on foundational issues and improving tests for better reliability and some more under the hood technical changes such as moving from in IDs to slugs when you&#8217;re relating a navigation menu to a block. So we&#8217;re looking for feedback on those proposals, so if anyone wants to input, please go along to that tracking issue and comment and we&#8217;d be only too glad to hear from you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. So there was, at the beginning of I think 5.8 or something like that, there was the idea to actually have a navigation screen also for organizing menus. Is it an idea to go back to that? Or is it all kind of happening in the sidebar? Do you know what the approach is going to be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yes. Yeah. I mean, the current thinking is that having a separate navigation editor screen, there was an experiment for that for a while in the plugin, that&#8217;s now been disabled, there&#8217;s no plan to continue to work on that. But instead the idea is to bring that ability to manage multiple menus into the editor canvas itself. If you think about things like templates and template parts, you can do that all within the editor, there&#8217;s focus modes for template parts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the same thing will hopefully apply to navigation, so you&#8217;ll be able to manage an individual navigation block and it&#8217;s associated menu within the editor within the block itself. But also if you have lots of other menus and you want to edit one that isn&#8217;t on the canvas, for example, there will be a global navigation sidebar that you can pop open from that W WordPress menu on the top left and there you&#8217;ll be able to choose the different menus and move things around, edit them, things like that. And so the foundational work for that should be going into 6.2, the actual screen may not appear in 6.2 but at least the foundational work will be going in to make that possible. So yeah, that&#8217;s the state of play on that particular aspect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, thank you to elaborate on that. And then, so Andrew Sorong has also created a new tracking issue for the layout options that are going to come after 6.1. And layouts are the ones that, for all the layout options, design tools and other refinements. And 6.1 comes with three layouts now, the flow layout, the flex layout, and the constraint layout, making it possible so the inner blocks are following their parents, so to speak, in that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are also additional improvements in the works. One was the fixed positions for head and footer template parts, meaning it&#8217;s stuck to the top or to the bottom. Also have some more layout consistencies, like an ad layout support to the cover block. Also some minor things like allow the change block cap in the editor and all that. So we&#8217;ll have that link also in the show notes, so the tracking issue, so you see what the team is working on and what they have on their priority list so you can follow along and also give input. It&#8217;s really important that people test along the way so it gets a more stable version of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Ooh, I&#8217;m excited about fixed position head and footer template parts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: A lot of people ask me about that for navigation, so I can imagine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I can imagine, yeah. So yeah, it seems that we are at the end of our show today. And I&#8217;m so happy, Dave, that you joined me today on going through the two change logs and talk about WordPress 6.1 and all these great tools that you brought in from the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: It was an absolute pleasure, thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Is there anything else that you wanted to alert our listeners to that we didn&#8217;t talk about before, before we close the show?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: No. Actually, I think we&#8217;ve covered quite a lot in this show. So no, thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes, we did. So when people want to reach you, how would they connect with you apart from the YouTube channel that we are going to put in the show notes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Sure. I think probably the best way is through WordPress Slack, I&#8217;m Get Dave on WordPress Slack. Feel free to send me a DM if you&#8217;d like to discuss anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent. And as always, the show notes will be published on GutenbergTimes.com/podcast, this is number 74. And if you have questions and suggestions and news you want to include, send them&#8230; Or you want us to include, send them to <a href=\"mailto:ChangeLog@GutenbergTimes.com\">ChangeLog@GutenbergTimes.com</a>, <a href=\"mailto:ChangeLog@GutenbergTimes.com\">ChangeLog@GutenbergTimes.com</a>. Thanks again for listening and being part of our show. Thank you, Dave. And this is goodbye for me, bye-bye.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Bye.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 15 Oct 2022 18:07:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Birgit Pauli-Haack\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"WPTavern: UniBlock: A Free Business Block Theme for WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=138471\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wptavern.com/uniblock-a-free-business-block-theme-for-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3855:\"<p>WPZOOM is coming in strong with its first block theme approved for the WordPress Themes Directory. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/uniblock/\">UniBlock</a> is a beautifully designed theme that is well-suited for businesses and freelancers. The company plans to adopt the concept of full-site editing in other WPZOOM themes as well, following the release of UniBlock.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>UniBlock&#8217;s default look is sporting a darker color palette in the navigation and above the fold, with a lighter background for the rest of the website. The video on the sample homepage uses the free <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpzoom-video-popup-block/\">WPZOOM Video Popup Block</a> plugin, which supports Vimeo and YouTube. It&#8217;s a simple, lightweight block that allows users to customize the play button and play icon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After activating the theme, clicking on &#8216;Customize&#8217; will prompt the user to install the video plugin. It can also be converted to a Custom HTML block or removed entirely at the user&#8217;s discretion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>UniBlock&#8217;s 19 custom block patterns include everything one might expect from a business theme but, most impressively, it ships with five full-page patterns:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Front Page</li>\n\n\n\n<li>About</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Services</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Blog</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Contact</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, users can assign the page template in the post settings to get the same effect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These full-page patterns are convenient for speedy page building. They make it possible to get a basic business website up in a matter of minutes. Here&#8217;s an example of the Services full-page pattern that will instantly embed when selected. Users can delete any sections they don&#8217;t need, add more blocks and patterns, and quickly fill in all their own information.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Separately there are patterns for a footer with text, links, multiple arrangements of featured boxes with text and button, multiple designs for call-to-action sections, pricing tables, team members with social icons, testimonials, header cover, sidebar, 404 page, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can delve even further into customizing the templates with the site editor, as UniBlock is packaged with nearly two dozen templates and template parts. Here they can also edit the menu and adjust global styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>WPZOOM is developing a Pro version of the theme to release in a few weeks with support for importing the whole demo, multiple color schemes, multiple demos, premium block patterns, and additional header and footer layouts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://demo.wpzoom.com/uniblock/\">Check out the demo</a> on the WPZOOM website to see the theme in action. WPZOOM has also written <a href=\"https://www.wpzoom.com/documentation/uniblock\">documentation for UniBlock</a>, which covers general topics like how to use block patterns, how to set up the front and blog pages, and how to create a menu in the site editor. Since the company&#8217;s most popular themes are what would be considered classic themes, UniBlock is new territory for most of their customers. It is so far the only block theme among WPZOOM&#8217;s collection of 31 themes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block theme adoption is slowly making its way across WordPress&#8217; major theme shops and the official directory is now hosting 160 themes tagged for full-site editing. As more longtime theme companies make their block theme debuts and develop a base for future themes, WordPress users may start to see a rapid acceleration of the number and variety of block themes available. UniBlock is so far one of the few block themes in the directory with a singular focus on business websites. It is available to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/uniblock/\">download for free from WordPress.org</a> or via the admin themes panel.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 15 Oct 2022 01:00:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:8:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 20:03:22 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 20:00:34 GMT\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 2\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20221028170402\";}', 'no');

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And today I have with me Nick Diego. Welcome, Nick, to the WordPress Briefing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:00:44]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you so much for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:46]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Before we get started, why don&#8217;t you tell me a bit about yourself, just kind of your history with WordPress and then what it is that you&#8217;ve been doing with the WordPress 6.1 release squad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:00:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so I&#8217;m actually kind of new to working with WordPress full-time. Up until about June of last year, I was in the hospitality industry for a career of 10 years. But I always loved doing WordPress on the side. And after the long pandemic, I figured it was time to kind of pursue my passion and work with WordPress full-time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that ultimately led to my current role as a developer advocate at WPEngine, where I focus primarily on WordPress and contribution to Core itself. And then I guess it was maybe March or April this year when <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/annezazu/\">Anne McCarthy</a>, who I&#8217;ve worked with a ton, she asked me if I&#8217;d be interested in helping out on 6.0 as an Editor Triage Lead which was an awesome experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now I&#8217;m back for 6.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:37]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s excellent. I always like to hear about people who are coming to do repeat tours of duty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:01:43]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:44]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I probably shouldn&#8217;t refer to working on WordPress releases as a tour of duty. However, I find that releases are so large and complex, and there are so many people in there now that working on them takes an entirely different skill set now than it used to take when WordPress was like 1% of the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think it&#8217;s a really big task, and I think it&#8217;s great when people were, like, that was either so good that I would do it again, or I would like a second go because I could do it better. Whichever way brings people to it. So, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:02:18]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, I was just gonna say that&#8217;s a great point because the Editor Triage Lead, which is the role that I currently have, was a brand new role for 6.0. The project kind of got so big that it kind of made sense to have a triage lead focused specifically on Gutenberg. Gutenberg&#8217;s such a big part of WordPress now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that&#8217;s where that role kind of came from, and now we&#8217;ve carried it over to 6.1. As the project grows, we need more people to come in and help make sure the release is as smooth as it can be.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Because of that promise of backward compatibility and all the things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:02:47]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:48]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cool. So, by the time this releases, if I recall correctly, we will have passed RC2, or RC2 is coming the next day or something like that. We&#8217;re right around the Release Candidate two. So you have been doing this for quite some time on this particular release. So far, what is the feature that you&#8217;re most excited about that&#8217;s going out in the 6.1 release?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:03:09]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, this is going to sound really boring, but it&#8217;s actually incredibly exciting. So, the most exciting quote-unquote feature that I&#8217;m excited about is the improved consistency and standardization of block controls that are coming in 6.1. So things like typography and color and borders and dimensions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are things and tools that we&#8217;ve had in a lot of core blocks, but it hasn&#8217;t been consistent throughout. And a ton of work has been done in 6.1 to establish that consistency. We&#8217;re not a hundred percent there, but typography, I think we&#8217;re at like 85% of all core blocks now support all the typography controls, and with each release as we head to 6.2, we&#8217;ll improve on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s really great for theme builders, theme designers, and users to be able to control the look and feel blocks consistently throughout the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:58]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was gonna immediately answer you earlier with like, there are no boring answers, there are no boring improvements. And as you were explaining why it is that you kind of thought it might be considered boring, I think it&#8217;s fair to say that anytime that you&#8217;re increasing the consistency and you&#8217;re increasing the confidence between what you saw on the back end and what you actually shipped on the front end– anytime you&#8217;re doing that, I think that that is exciting in the prove the negative way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think about the negative excitement that occurs when you have published something, and it looks one way in the back end, and then it looks totally different on the front end, and the panic you feel when you have to fix. Not having that is a really big step up, I think. And so anything that provides more consistency for people who are using WordPress, people who are building with WordPress, I always find exciting. But also, like, I&#8217;m an office person, and so I would find office things exciting, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:04:53]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It creates a more delightful experience. I do a lot of work on the Training team, doing educational things, and we teach people how to change typography and change color. Once they learn how to do it in one block, if they can take that same skill set and apply it to any other block, it&#8217;s that light bulb moment. They understand they know how to manipulate and use WordPress to its fullest. So adding that consistency really helps to level up users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:15]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m gonna take us off track a little bit and just ask a general question here. Like, I remember the first time that I was working with what was a site, I guess, qualified for a site at the time. And I remember the first time that I discovered that I could change the look and feel with HTML and CSS, and I did that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also was like, well, I accept my fate. Whatever happens, if I kill everything I&#8217;ve ever written, that is just how it&#8217;ll be. Like the sheer terror of all of that is so different now. Do you recall that first moment where you&#8217;re like, Oh, I do have some power over this? I have some control over this, and whether you also found it scary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:05:52]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I came to WordPress kinda as a hobby and website development kind of as a hobby. So I was kind of always in that tinkering phase, or I wasn&#8217;t building something for anyone else. I was in a safe place to destroy whatever I was working on with my tinkering. So I never really quite had that fear, but I can definitely see it from the perspective of building something for somebody else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you&#8217;re right, the editor and the controls that we have, and you know, now make it a lot easier to kind of manipulate and exert your creative desires in WordPress than it was before with CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:23]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love the phrase ‘I was safe to destroy things, ’ and if I can figure out a way to make it a tagline for something, I will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:06:30]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:31]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright. So during your second time around here on the release squad with 6.1, what have been the bright spots of that experience, and have there been any unexpected challenges of being on the release squad?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:06:44]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, I come to WordPress from, you know, from a different career. It&#8217;s kind of a passion of mine to be working with WordPress. So I kinda have a unique experience than maybe some others. And when I approach WordPress, there&#8217;s always that tendency to say, ‘why doesn&#8217;t it do this?’ Or ‘why don&#8217;t they do this?’ And I&#8217;ve always been the person…, well, it&#8217;s open source. We, we, we can, we can</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>…can do it</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:07:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>…we can do it. And so that&#8217;s kind of how I approach things. Now, of course, you know, I have the privilege of time to do that. Not everybody does, but one of the unexpected bright spots about working in a release squad is understanding how it all works.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How does WordPress actually get built? What is the process that it goes through? It was just eye-opening to me, and I really got a shout-out, Anne, for inviting me to be on 6.0. It brought me in. I learned so much about it, and now I&#8217;m just excited to keep working on these releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a release is hard. You know, it&#8217;s a… WordPress is huge. There are a lot of moving parts, there are a lot of things going on. Right now, we&#8217;re trying to get everything ready for the first release candidate. So being on the release squad is not an easy job. But it&#8217;s exciting, it&#8217;s fun, and you really feel like you&#8217;re part of that ‘we’ really helping to build WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:53]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that I hope that people have learned from any time that they spent working with me is that like we understand here in the WordPress open source project, and I believe that all open source projects must understand this, but like every change that you make, if there are things that are dependent on it, which is gonna be true for most of us, we&#8217;ll have intended consequences and also unexpected consequences, and unintended, unexpected consequences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I&#8217;ve always felt like the thing that really makes the biggest difference about how we do open source in WordPress is that, for the most part, we have a concept of where the most likely changes are going to happen across our entire ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a better understanding, at least compared to when I got here, a better understanding of how interconnected it all is. And so you&#8217;ve got this change here, and it looks small, but it&#8217;s gonna have this positive or negative impact as you kind of work your way out from it. And so I think that that is an interesting thing, and certainly, you get a really clear concept of it in the release squad, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:09:02]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, absolutely. If you were to build something like the block editor without caring at all about backward compatibility, you&#8217;d be done by now, right? I mean, so much of what we do is concerning ourselves with making sure that everybody who&#8217;s on a classic theme or hybrid theme or whatever it might be that they continue to use WordPress in a safe and stable way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is part of being such a large content management system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you already told us the feature that you&#8217;re most excited about, and so now I&#8217;m gonna ask you about what feature or what bug fix has the most notable improvements that are coming to 6.1. This is a little different as in, like, there&#8217;s the thing you&#8217;re excited about, which is an office thing, but like a thing that is maybe not new but has the biggest delta, the biggest change to anyone&#8217;s experience of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:09:51]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so obviously, in 5.9, we introduced full site editing, and 6.0 was a natural progression from that with more and more features. Now it&#8217;s safe to say that there&#8217;s only a small fraction of websites that are using the whole full site editing of or block themes, all that kind of stuff. One of the hangups about that was managing templates inside of the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could add the files to your theme, which would then show up in the site editor. But there wasn&#8217;t a direct way to add more complicated templates within the site editor itself. That is changing in 6.1. So now you actually have the functionality to install something like 2023, which is the new core theme, and build out all these very complicated templates within the UI of the site editor that you could not have done before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:10:38]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I personally think that the biggest benefit of full site editing is really to empower no-code or low-code users. And the ability to add these templates directly in the UI really levels them up. Because now, you can do all that complicated stuff that you normally would need to be adding to theme files and jumping into the code. You can do that within the site editor now, which I think is fantastic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:59]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s great. And just a general caveat, anytime that we talk about anything that&#8217;s very developer-y or very no code-y, I think it&#8217;s always worth mentioning, yes, a lot of what we&#8217;re trying to do with the block editor is to just kind of give some power back to folks who cannot find the time to become a developer or don&#8217;t have the inclination. They don&#8217;t want to do that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that does not mean that no code is ever involved in WordPress. It&#8217;s still a software. You can still do very complicated things with it. And if you are a developer, you should not think to yourself, ‘oh now that it&#8217;s being available to low code/no code users, that means you don&#8217;t want me.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, that&#8217;s not at all what&#8217;s happening. You can do very complicated things still.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:11:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A hundred percent. A hundred percent. Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:45]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, so that brings us to our final question here because we like to stay as true to the name as possible here on the WP Briefing. If someone were wanting to get involved with the next release, so WP 6.2, how would they do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:12:01]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, talk to Anne, and she&#8217;ll get you set up. No, I&#8217;m just kidding. So at the, after each release, there&#8217;s a posting that goes out that lists all the different release teams, and you can just put your name out there and ask to be, you know, for consideration to be part of the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I will say that the best thing you can do right now is help with 6.1. You don&#8217;t necessarily need to be a release lead to do that testing, helping with bug fixes. Reach out to me. Reach out to other release leads, and we&#8217;ll get you involved and engaged with the release. That will give you a really good framework to start working and become a release lead for 6.2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:12:37]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I think we talked maybe two or three episodes ago, or it could be more than that, I&#8217;ll never know, about the release squad, like the group that&#8217;s doing that. In the event you think to yourself, ‘there&#8217;s no way in a million years that I&#8217;m gonna just show up tomorrow and be part of the release squad,’ I heard what they said in the first question/answer moment– that&#8217;s fine, too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Nick mentioned, you can always get involved with testing, you can get involved with triage. Those are areas where any feedback at all is valuable because we can get better information about what worked and didn&#8217;t, what was expected versus what happened. And that type of information is where all of our co-creators of the WordPress software–really, we rely on what you all are pointing out to us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re not shining spotlights on the most painful parts of your experience, sometimes we don&#8217;t necessarily know that that&#8217;s a pain point for anyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:13:34]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so yeah, that&#8217;s a great place to start. If you are more of a writer, technical or prose, there are different spaces you can go to, like keep our docs up to date or make sure that people know that changes are coming at all in WordPress because that&#8217;s a thing. If you are a backend developer, we have a million things you can do because that&#8217;s just all day, every day, for WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s just all the deep backend work. And so yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:13:58]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did want to mention that, you know, being on the release team does not necessarily mean that you&#8217;re incredibly technical. We have a documentation lead, we have a design lead, you know, a communication lead. So there&#8217;s a lot of different roles in the team that, you know, across all disciplines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So don&#8217;t think if you&#8217;re not a hardcore developer, that precludes you from being on the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:19]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and if you&#8217;re really good with common sense and working fully remotely, you can be the release coordinator. I can tell you because I did that for 5.0. It was a big job. It was our, it was the first time we had a release squad as opposed to just like the release lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because there was just so much that was going into that and so much riding on it. And like you said in some other answer that you gave like if you were to just be like, we&#8217;re shutting everything down and rewriting this in six months, and I hope you can come with us on it. Like a lot of open source projects do it that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:51]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is a choice, and we made the opposite choice. And so we&#8217;re bringing all of our co-conspirators with us, all of our co-creators of WordPress. That&#8217;s the hope all the time. Making sure that they have enough information, that they feel safe to destroy things, enough information, and skills about how to get out of it, that they always feel some high confidence in what they&#8217;re trying to do versus what they actually did do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, excellent. Nick, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:15:20]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nope. I just hope everybody goes out and downloads 6.1 and enjoys it as much as I am.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:25]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, go check it out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. And actually, it is a pretty big list today, but still pretty big things too. So first up, we have a call for testing that is out, and it is for our Android users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a call for testing for WordPress for Android 20.9, and I feel like we don&#8217;t get a lot of calls for testing for Android devices. And so if you have been feeling left out or just like we don&#8217;t always have that kind of mobile testing available, this is the opportunity for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing is that tomorrow, we have RC2, release candidate two for WordPress 6.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s coming out on October 18th. There will be a link in the show notes, but that means if you write a plugin or a theme or have anything that kind of extends the core of WordPress, now is the time to start testing anything that might be a bug or represent a breaking change and make sure that you file those bugs so that we can get things as settled and excellent as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:16:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of Word points, uh, WordPress 6.1, not Word point, WordPress 6.1. I actually have three changes that I think are going to represent some pretty big changes for folks. I will have links to all of these in the show notes. If you don&#8217;t know where the show notes are, it&#8217;s on wordpress.org/news/podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the three things that I think are gonna be big, worthwhile things. The first one is multisite improvements, and the second one will be the style engine that&#8217;s block styles generation tool, which will ship in Core and I think is really important for y&#8217;all to take a look at. And then also there are some changes coming to the block editor preferences.<br><br>Like I said, links to all of those are going to be in the show notes, and so they should be pretty easy for you to find. But also, if you want to just get a general look at everything that&#8217;s coming in 6.1, we did a walkthrough that I will link to in the show notes as well, and you can get a full understanding of what is going to be coming early in November.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:17:45]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list –big list– of big things. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13578\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"The Month in WordPress – September 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/10/the-month-in-wordpress-september-2022/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 10:07:36 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"month in wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13596\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:179:\"September was an exciting month with the return of many in-person WordCamps, WordPress Translation Day, and preparations for WordPress 6.1.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I have with us today on the WordPress Briefing a couple of special guests. I have <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ironprogrammer/\">Brian Alexander</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/annezazu/\">Anne McCarthy</a>. I&#8217;m gonna ask you both to tell us a little bit about yourselves, if you can tell us what you do with the WordPress project, maybe how long you&#8217;ve been with WordPress, and if there are any particular teams that you contribute to, that would be great.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian, why don&#8217;t you get us started?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:01:02]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Brian. I work on the WordPress project as a full-time contributor, sponsored by Automattic. And I am one of the Test Team reps, so I help promote testing across the project. And that&#8217;s not just in Core, but it could be for Themes, Performance, feature plugins, what have you. So try to make that stuff move forward and wrangle as many people as we can to get on board and help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:32]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent. All right, and Anne, what about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:01:36]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spearhead the Full Site Editing outreach program. I am a sponsor contributor for Automattic as well, and so I contribute across a couple of different teams depending upon what the outreach program needs as well as various release squads I have been a part of. So for 6.1 coming up, I&#8217;m one of the co-Core Editor triage leads.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian is also on the squad as the co-Test lead, which is very exciting. So it&#8217;s been fun to work with him and be on the podcast. And I&#8217;ve been around the WordPress project since about 2011. But this is, the last couple of years, the first time I&#8217;ve been able to be sponsored by Automattic and be a part of giving back to the community that&#8217;s given me so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:13]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazing. All right. For folks who&#8217;ve been listening to the WP Briefing for a while, you know that I&#8217;ve been saying for like a full year that I think that testing is one of the best onboarding opportunities we have. And then also I really like to bring in our co-creators of WordPress through that testing program. Because we don&#8217;t know whether we&#8217;re right or not unless people tell us that we&#8217;re right or not. And we would like to hear so much from the users who, you know, use it and don&#8217;t necessarily have an opportunity, that privilege to kind of build on it or build the CMS itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I just have a few questions since I&#8217;ve got a couple of our strong testing wranglers here. The first thing I have is what are you doing? Or, do you have any advice for getting people outside of our active contributor base and the community to participate in testing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:03:03]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can kick this off. Just thinking about the Full Site Editing outreach program model. So just for context, there are various calls for testing in different formats. So everything from really procedural where you&#8217;re following exact steps to follow, to very open-ended calls for testing, as well as we recently did usability testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of the things that come to mind immediately just for getting different contributors is to have very specific, fun, engaging, relevant tests that can draw people in. So if you have a call for testing that really speaks to someone, they might be more willing to participate. As well as just different formats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So someone may not want to, you know, follow 30 steps, but they might want to follow something more open-ended. They might want to answer a survey rather than opening a GitHub link. And so I think a lot of facilitation with the outreach program has served us really well to bring in different folks as well as explicitly reaching out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve done a number of talks in different WordPress related spaces and non-WordPress spaces to try to tell people about what we&#8217;re up to and really go meet them where they are. Because I think that&#8217;s ultimately, especially with Covid and the pandemic, there was a really unique opportunity to do that and to join the random online meetup that was happening and talk about the program and talk about ways that people could get involved and feel heard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:04:12]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the last thing I&#8217;ll mention is translations. The program that&#8217;s culture testing that I write is written in English, but I&#8217;m very fortunate to have people who translate those. And so that&#8217;s a huge way that I cannot contribute but that other people have. And so I really want to highlight that and call that out because it&#8217;s been hugely impactful to have these calls for testing in a way that people can more readily access.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:32]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:04:35]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I was going to add in, in addition to the calls for testing that are, as Anne said, structured such to isolate so that someone can just kind of go through a list of steps to do rather than just being exposed to Trac or GitHub and have kind of snow blindness with, with everything that&#8217;s happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a Week in Test series of posts that goes out about every week. And what we try to do with that series is to curate a list of posts that might be a good starting point. So we try to find one that, in each type of testing example, is something that would, a more novice contributor might be able to start with. Things for more intermediate and then also advanced ones that, for testers who may need to have a development environment and the ability to make some pretty deep or type of customizations to their WordPress project in order to test a patch or reproduce a particular issue that might be happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s a good springboard for someone to come in where there&#8217;s just a small thing that they can kind of look at and then dive into the larger process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:46]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely. That&#8217;s very smart. It&#8217;s hard to figure out how to get started in WordPress at all, let alone as a contributing by testing things sort of area. That feels new to WordPress even though the team has been around for a long time. And so I think that&#8217;s excellent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian, you mentioned in your note about who you are and what you&#8217;re doing that you&#8217;re helping with testing not only in the test section in the Test Team but then also across the project. So, I have a follow-up question for you. What can developers do to create better tests for their software?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:06:18]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are sections within the Core handbook that kind of go into detail about the types of tests that should accompany individual contributions. A lot of those require kind of an extra step, and some developers maybe don&#8217;t have as much experience there. So hopefully, the Core handbook can provide a little bit of that guidance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a lot of contributors who are interested in things such as unit testing, E2E testing, which is end-to-end testing, and testing in JavaScript or in PHP. So there&#8217;s a wide variety of the types of tests that you can actually contribute to. And I would say maybe about 50% of the tickets that I&#8217;ve triaged, personally, the contributor who brought in the patch was unable to or was not familiar with providing unit tests. So that is a very good opportunity for someone to come in who maybe is not as well versed in the depth of what the patch was involved with. But by contributing a user test, they get an opportunity to look very focused at a particular piece of code, what was modified, and then create unit tests based on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:07:40]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then once that unit test has been submitted and starting to be reviewed, other reviewers, Core contributors, or Core committers, I would say, they&#8217;ll start looking at that and if there are additional details that should be there, expanding the tests or little modifications. Then that also is feedback to that test contributor so that the next time they come in, they&#8217;re more prepared for it. They&#8217;re learning more about Core, and eventually, maybe they&#8217;ll also become a Core contributor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:07]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent. We will include links to these handbook pages and documentation in the show notes if you&#8217;re listening to the podcast on your favorite podcasting platform, Pocketcasts, or it&#8217;s somewhere else. I don&#8217;t know where people listen to podcasts, but if you&#8217;re listening to it somewhere that&#8217;s not on the website, you can come to get that on wordpress.org/news.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, the next question that I have, and I think this is for both of you, Brian, it sounds like you partially answered it, but I bet there are more answers from Anne as well. What advice do you have for those submitting bug reports?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:08:38]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll chime in to start, and then Brian, I&#8217;d love to hear your unique take because I also think you do an excellent job whenever I&#8217;ve engaged with you in various places of providing really good replication steps. And so I love that, and I wanna offer things specific to WordPress itself and something that I&#8217;ve noticed that&#8217;s more cultural rather than necessarily like steps to follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of the things I&#8217;ve noticed that I think has started to come up partially with Covid is people, you know, you start talking at WordCamps or at a meetup, and a bug comes up, and you find someone who knows where to put it, and that kind of connection is has been frayed in the last couple years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so one of the things I feel like I&#8217;ve been saying to a lot of different people at this unique point in time is that it doesn&#8217;t need to be perfect. Don&#8217;t let perfect be the enemy of good. And so if it means you just need to drop it in a Slack channel and you just are like, I don&#8217;t know where to put this, that&#8217;s huge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to hear from people across the project. And I just really encourage anyone, even if you don&#8217;t have the complete information or you&#8217;re not a hundred percent sure you&#8217;re afraid it&#8217;s been reported 10 times before, like, please still report it because we need those reports and also if 10 people reported it and it&#8217;s still not fixed, that also means we need to iterate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:09:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that&#8217;s one of the things, especially with the Full Site Editing outreach program, I feel people will message me saying, hey, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard this a bunch, but… And sometimes I&#8217;ve never heard it at all. And I shudder to think of all the people who have not reached out or have not posted in GitHub or Trac or wherever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, share, and write blog posts. I think that another great way that people can give feedback is if you don&#8217;t know how to get into the depths of WordPress, writing a post and talking about it and sharing it on social media is also a great way to get attention. I read a lot of those. But as much as possible, getting to, if you can, if you&#8217;re comfortable, getting to the source where we&#8217;re able to see it in Github or Trac goes a really long way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And share as much as you can. And don&#8217;t worry if you can&#8217;t spend hours writing the perfect bug report, we still wanna hear from you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:10:21]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Building off of what Anne said, just the fact that you&#8217;re speaking out and raising an issue is a huge step for many, many people. And once, once you&#8217;ve actually done that, as Anne said, it doesn&#8217;t need to be perfect. There are a lot of other people who are going to be looking at these bugs, trying to figure out the replication steps used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So even if you can&#8217;t provide all this detail up front, someone will help. On the back end, they&#8217;ll help kind of fill in those gaps. If you do have the time to actually get deep into providing a very detailed bug report, then there are some key aspects of the bug report that make it very helpful for contributors, not only testers, who should be able to reproduce the issue to validate and make sure that this isn&#8217;t something that&#8217;s unique, unique to a plugin, to a custom theme or snippet that you dropped into your functions PHP.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, also for the actual Core contributors, who then need to be able to understand what is happening so that they can fix the right thing. And some of those items are the information about your testing environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:11:34]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that could be your browser, your server, the type, whether it&#8217;s Apache, Nginx, et cetera, the operating system you&#8217;re running, what version of PHP you&#8217;re running, the version of WordPress, very critical, and…&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:49]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Super important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:11:51]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any themes and plugins that you&#8217;re using. And that kind of information helps set the stage, and then other people will be able to set up their environment similarly if they&#8217;re going to try to test it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After you have provided the environmental information, the steps required to reproduce the issue should be as detailed as possible. You may not have realized that clicking this caused such and such to happen, so just try to remember, or maybe even walk through if it&#8217;s something you can repeat multiple times, walk through a couple of times and write down everything that you&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:12:30]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that you&#8217;re sure, hey, this is the way that I can reproduce this bug. And then those steps will be very helpful for other contributors when they&#8217;re reviewing it. And then it&#8217;s also very helpful if you have video, screenshots, debug logs, any of those other kinds of resources that you could refer to because not all bugs are easy to explain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we tend to… Trac and GitHub issues for the Gutenberg project, everybody&#8217;s writing in English. And maybe your main language is not English, and it might be a little bit challenging to do that. So providing a video, it&#8217;s worth a thousand words in any language. So, if you can provide those types of assets, that&#8217;s also very important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:13:22]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and I&#8217;ll share a little bit of a you&#8217;re-not-alone-in-it sort of anecdotes from the first few bugs that I ever filed for WordPress. I sort of had this feeling that if I were to file a bug, everyone would know that I wasn&#8217;t a developer. And like everyone knows, I&#8217;m not a developer, but a little bit I was like, they&#8217;ll know now. And so if that&#8217;s where you are also,&nbsp; Anne said it, and Brian said it as well, like, we can&#8217;t fix things that we don&#8217;t realize are broken. And just because you&#8217;ve run into it 15 times, which obviously should never happen, you should run into it once, and then we know, but it happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you run into it 15 times, probably other people have as well. And if it&#8217;s still not fixed, it might be because no one has thought to themselves I should tell someone that&#8217;s broken. And so if that&#8217;s your primary hurdle, folks out there in our listening space, I was once there too. And honestly, knowing that it&#8217;s a problem is as valuable as knowing the solution to it most of the time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:14:23]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and those are, I wanted to add, there is a lot to that to remember. That&#8217;s a lot to remember in terms of what you should be submitting, what, or I should say, what would be ideal in what you&#8217;re submitting. But luckily, in the test handbook, there&#8217;s a test report section, and it includes a description, it goes everything from, it starts with why we do bug reports to examples of the types of testing, whether it be for bugs or enhancements, which also need testing, and it has templates in there that you can copy and paste directly into Trac. And that&#8217;s very helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah,, we will have links to those in the show notes as well. Since we&#8217;re right there at that moment, what do you think we could do as WordPress to make reporting problems easier?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:15:15]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that this has been something that&#8217;s come up during our weekly meetings, discussions on the Core test channel, as well as in contributor day test table discussions. And the test documentation that&#8217;s on the website is a little bit fragmented. I believe that the current test handbook was originally written for a type of flow analysis and feedback testing that is not the norm today. So it&#8217;s a little bit confusing. The terminology is a little dated, and the most recent updates that have been provided on there relate solely to Gutenberg, which is very important that that also be represented, but, in order to find information about testing and Trac or PHP unit tests, you have to go over to the core handbook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we could definitely make things improved by consolidating, bringing everything into one area so that if you are interested in testing, you&#8217;ll have everything in one place and not be split between that and not have outdated methodologies that are asking you to submit videos that nobody&#8217;s going to really look at because we&#8217;re not doing the flow tests anymore. So I think that that would be a benefit to future testers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:16:41]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne, any thoughts?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:16:43]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I&#8217;ll also add that I think there are like two things we can do. One is, there&#8217;s so much happening in the WordPress project in such a cool way that I think the more we can write targeted tests and talk to people about, like, hey, here&#8217;s this new thing coming. This is a high-impact area to test. It&#8217;s under active iteration. You&#8217;re gonna get a lot of engagement. People are really thinking about this and pulling people into that where you kind of get the momentum of getting the feedback in right when someone needs it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we could do that a bit more to make reporting problems easier because it&#8217;s kind of like you&#8217;re in the thick of it with a lot of people rather than maybe exploring an area where someone hasn&#8217;t looked at it in a minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that’s the thing that comes to mind is just the more we can take the time. I think this release cycle has been really good with that, where there&#8217;s been a call for testing for fluid typography. There&#8217;s also been one for using block template parts and classic themes. And there&#8217;s a ton of stuff that&#8217;s been happening where we can kind of make these both developer and more end user testing experiences easier and better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Brian has done a great job continuing the tradition of, you know, helping test this latest release cycle. And he&#8217;s taken those posts and done an amazing job of helping, having specific testing as well. Tied to this, I think just this has always been a thing but better, easier testing environments for developers and for quickly setting up more WordPress sites to test things for end users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:17:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Another thing that we have been discussing in Slack in the Core and Core Test channels is the possibility of pre-populating the Trac tickets. With a template based on what it is that you&#8217;re reporting. So similar to copying a template for a test report out of the handbook. Instead, you would hit a button to say the type of bug you are submitting, and then it would pre-populate that, and then you could fill in the gaps for that. This already happens over in Gutenberg. There, there are templates, and I find that that is very helpful. And so being able to do that in Trac would be useful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then for reporting problems on the user side, I thought that it would be interesting to have like you have for any other modern app, a button that says Report Bug in WordPress that could capture some intelligence data for your installation, the page that you&#8217;re on and have a simple text box where you could provide a little description and then submit that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:19:08]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, these wouldn&#8217;t be the types of things that would just go straight into Trac, most likely. However, it would be an opportunity to allow end users to just send something in, and start having it looked at, rather than looking and saying, okay, I found a bug in WordPress. Now, what do I do?&nbsp; And then not reporting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that would be the worst case is that the bug just doesn&#8217;t get reported. So that would be information that is already harvested if you go to your site health screen and your WordPress installation. A lot of that information that would be useful is there. In this type of bug report, we would want to anonymize and strip a lot of that information out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of private stuff you don&#8217;t wanna share, but there is that data there that&#8217;s available that could potentially help in doing a bug report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:19:57]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brilliant. All right. Question for everyone in the room: what opportunities are there currently to help with testing? Anne, I know, and you already mentioned a few, we can just bombard everybody with links to the tests if we want. But yeah, what opportunities are currently out there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:20:13]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I&#8217;ll mention the Full Site Editing outreach program. I&#8217;m very biased, but we&#8217;re always looking for new folks. We just crossed, I think, 600 people, which was unbelievable. So even if you&#8217;re not necessarily always able to help join the calls for testing, you can always pop into the FSE outreach experiment channel, which we&#8217;ll also add a link to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s just a great way when you have time to join because I flag stuff all the time, whether it&#8217;s about the outreach program or just in general across the project. Brian does really good weekly round-up testing posts as well. So make.wordpress.org/test is also a great place to get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then right now, I think when this comes out, will be a great time to be helping test WordPress 6.1. So check out that post. I kind of wanna just shove everyone in that direction currently cause I think that&#8217;s the most high-impact thing to get involved with and one of the great ways to give back to the next version of WordPress to make it really delightful and easy to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m just gonna leave it there, even though there are so many ways you can help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:21:11]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.1 coming out on November 1st if you haven&#8217;t yet heard about it. Brian, what else have you got out there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:21:16]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the online stuff, Anne covered that pretty well. I would say if you have a local WordCamp, sign up for their contributor day or if there are any local WordPress meetups. When Covid ended up hitting and lockdowns were rolled out, a lot of this stuff started to really slow down. So I think now is a good time to maybe introduce the idea for, hey, let&#8217;s have a local meetup, and for a couple of hours, we&#8217;ll just do some testing, and look at some stuff in WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it might be a good way of getting people re-engaged. It&#8217;s a little bit lighter weight if you&#8217;re doing testing versus trying to actually provide a patch to fix an issue. So, might be a good way of bringing in some new faces and re-engaging people who we lost over the lockdown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:22:09]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and if you all have never done a testing party for WordPress before, and it sounds like it&#8217;s maybe a really boring thing, it&#8217;s actually not, she said with strong authority and opinions. But also, I have never had a more successful learning experience with the WordPress CMS than when I was trying to figure it out with other people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They see things that you don&#8217;t see, they know things you don&#8217;t know, and it really covers a lot of the bases for unknown unknowns when you&#8217;re trying to learn something. And then also you have all these people that like, we’re really in it with you, and everyone&#8217;s really pulling for each other, and it&#8217;s actually a bit more fun than it sounds like when you&#8217;re just like, a testing party. It turns into just like jointly solving a puzzle together, which I think sounds like a lot of fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like a party, but for technology, I would feel this way. I am a mad extrovert, and we all know it, but. Now you two know it as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:23:08]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a final, just like a fun question for you both, and if you have an answer, great. And if you don&#8217;t have an answer, I would be surprised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here we go. Last question of the day. If five more volunteers suddenly appeared to help on the Test Team, what would they do? Just, I waved a magic wand. I guess that&#8217;s what made it fun. I don&#8217;t know why. I was like, fun question and then I&#8217;m, like, assigned tasks that, Yeah, I waved a magic wand. That&#8217;s what made it fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:23:38]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I would say I would probably point them to FSE outreach program posts because…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:23:45]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Woot woot.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:23:47]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>…the outreach program does a great job of outlining steps. You&#8217;re isolating testing in one particular area. It&#8217;s got a lot of tests. There&#8217;s examples of the types of feedback that you&#8217;re looking for, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a really good introduction to it, and most FSE testing does not require a local dev environment. Which is probably the biggest hurdle for a new tester coming in. If you do have developers with more experience, then they could start–and they wanted to look into Trac tickets or GitHub issues– then it does take a little bit of setup and you may spend the next few hours configuring your development environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So instead, I would recommend that you start with something like FSE outreach program posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:24:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did not pay Brian to say that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:24:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re just all partial to it here. That&#8217;s all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:24:45]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, we really are. Yeah, no, this is, I love this question, and I actually find it really fun cause I think about it a lot. And we&#8217;ve talked about some of this stuff too, and it&#8217;s something that when I think about five more people suddenly appearing, makes me giddy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we have folks, who have helped with like, I think I&#8217;ve mentioned like translations and group testing and even responding to questions that come from the channel and like, I just wish if we had five folks full time dedicated to that, I could see way more hallway hangouts where we casually talk about stuff and actually go on a call and talk live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could see folks, someone dedicated to helping translations and translating even more places. We have an Italian contributor who does it regularly, and a couple of Japanese contributors every once in awhile we get Spanish translation. But I&#8217;d love to see more translations to bring more people in, more facilitating group testing, more types of testing, helping me be more creative because sometimes I get a creative wall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But more than anything, if I really think long term about the project and thinking about this outreach program model, which I don&#8217;t think I fully appreciated how new it was, Josepha, when you introduced the idea, I think it would be so neat to bring in more folks to actually create new outreach programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:25:52]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So maybe there&#8217;s an outreach program for theme authors or block theme authors, or maybe there&#8217;s an outreach program around collaborative editing. Like what does this look like, and how can we expand this to bring more people in? And I think a lot of that will prove the resiliency and lessons we&#8217;ve learned from Covid in the WordPress community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can&#8217;t necessarily always rely on the meetup groups, so how can we meet people where they are? And I think there&#8217;s something really interesting and almost serendipitous that the outreach program started literally, I think it was like May 2020, like a couple of months into the pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I, like, I want to see it in a position of strength where we both have the in-person community alongside this outreach program model that can intertwine work. And I&#8217;d love to see the model expand to different types. And right now, maybe part of that is we use the outreach program model, the full site editing outreach program group itself, to experiment more and to keep that level of experimentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s something I feel really strongly about is continuing to find what works and what doesn&#8217;t. And so if we had five more people, I could just, I&#8217;d probably go wild and have all sorts of cool, cool things and spinoffs, but I&#8217;m more introverted than Josepha, so there&#8217;s limitations to this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:26:56]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, you heard it here first. If you&#8217;re one of my 6,000 listeners. I only need five of one of you. Five of the ones of you to come and make Anne&#8217;s whole life an exciting joy for the next 12 months. So, I only need five of you and I know that you&#8217;re out there. There are 2000 or something, 6,000. I have no idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got more than 1000 of you listening, and I know that you wanna come and help Anne cuz she&#8217;s a delight. I know you wanna come help Brian cuz he&#8217;s a delight. Both of you. This was such a fun conversation. Thank you for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:27:29]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you, Josepha. Thank you, Anne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:27:31]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:27:33]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there it is a bit of a deep dive on the Test Team and how to get started on it. Like I mentioned, we&#8217;ll have a ton of links in the show notes over on wordpress.org/news. And I wanna remind folks that if you have questions or thoughts that you&#8217;d like to hear from me about, you can always email us at WPbriefing@wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:27:58]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. First and foremost, we are counting down the days to the WordPress 6.1 release. We are within a month of the target release date. So if you have not tested the latest version with your plugins or themes, now is the time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, we are seeing translated tutorials being submitted on learn.wordpress.org. I&#8217;m delighted to see that happening, and I encourage any polyglots out there who feel called to consider translating one into your language and help other people feel empowered to use WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing is that the WordPress Speaker Workshop for Women Voices in India just concluded, so to celebrate, we&#8217;ve opened registrations for the WordPress Speaker Workshop for Women Voices in Latin America. Unlike the last one, this event takes place in person on October 29th. And so I&#8217;ll include a link to registrations for that in the show notes as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosey, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13551\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"WordPress 6.1 Beta 2 Now Available\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/09/wordpress-6-1-beta-2-now-available/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 18:12:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"6.1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13533\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:306:\"WordPress 6.1 Beta 2 is now available for download and testing.\n\nThis version of the WordPress software is under development.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:41]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For folks who are new to WordPress in the past couple of years, you may have heard people talk about WordPress events with a sort of passion that really is hard to describe. For me, I know our events are the dark matter of what makes this global, fully distributed, multifaceted project come together so well in the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also know that WordPressers have so many different reasons for coming together. So we took a little wander through WordCamp US to get their take on why they use WordPress and also why they go to WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:13]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So WordCamp US is back in person for the first time since 2019. What are you most excited about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Topher 00:01:19]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am Topher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing everyone, the interpersonal relationships, the communication, the expressions on people&#8217;s faces that you don&#8217;t get via email or Slack or whatever. Just being near people again and enjoying each other&#8217;s company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jen Miller 00:01:35]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Jen Miller.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was most excited to see my friends. It&#8217;s been a long time to try to maintain connections via social media and, you know, texting and phone calls. But being here and being a part of the WordPress community has made everything great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Courtney Robertson 00:01:54]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney Robertson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributor day, of course, that&#8217;s how I got really connected to the WordPress community. And I am hoping we have a great turnout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:02]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>How long have you been a contributor to WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Kathy Drewien 00:02:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Kathy Drewien.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started in 2008 by attending my first WordCamp. Two years later, I was part of the organizing team for WordCamp Atlanta. I have been on that team for one role or another. Well, I can&#8217;t tell you how many years now. From then, until now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Stine 00:02:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Alex Stine. About six years now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Topher 00:02:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>About 12 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started going to WordCamp, then working in the support forums, and just grew from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Courtney Robertson 00:02:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started checking guests in, at my first WordCamp in 2009, which I see as one avenue of contributing. I joined a team officially in 2014.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Courtney Patubo Kranzke </strong><strong>00:02:47]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Courtney Patubo Kranzke.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been an on-and-off contributor to WordPress since like the mid-2000s, but I&#8217;ve been a sponsored contributor since 2016.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Dustin Hartzler </strong><strong>00:03:02]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Dustin Hartzler.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started a WordPress podcast in 2010. And I did like 500 episodes in a row without a break and without a week worth of rest. So I consider that my contribution to WordPress. I have a couple of core contributions, like I, I fixed a little bug here, a little bug there in a couple of releases, I think back in the four eras, 4.1 or 4.2 or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2010 is when I really got started in giving back, and, like, sharing my knowledge with the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:03:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is it important for you to attend WordCamps or contribute to the WordPress project?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Ricardas Kudirka </strong><strong>00:03:33]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Ricardas Kudirka.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, for everyone who&#8217;s using WordPress, it&#8217;s really important to understand how big the community is that we have here. So the community is an important and crucial part of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for it to grow, you need to attend the WordCamps, you need to share knowledge, and you need to meet people. So networking here and while meeting the exciting people who are developing WordPress or who are contributing to it, who are providing the services, who enable people to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a crucial point for everyone to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Kathy Drewien </strong><strong>00:04:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to attend them because it&#8217;s very hard to describe them. We are not like any other thing you have ever done in your life. You have to be here to get it. And then once you get it, you wanna do more of it. It&#8217;s magical. It&#8217;s magical. There&#8217;s no way to get that experience without being here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of contributing, it&#8217;s a responsible thing to do. You want to give back instead of get, get, get. In the beginning, we&#8217;re all about the get, get, get. And then you go, oh my gosh. I didn&#8217;t know. I didn&#8217;t know I could do this. I didn&#8217;t know I had to write code. I can actually just stand around and talk to people and contribute to the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Jen Miller </strong><strong>00:04:50]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it&#8217;s a community effort, and so if we want it to progress and grow, we need to put our own individual effort into the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, we make friends, we make connections, and we find people who we can help and who can help us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Alex Stine </strong><strong>00:05:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel it is important to support the community that got me my start in technology and make sure that people understand that accessibility is very much a requirement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, we need to make sure we keep the community inclusive for all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:05:21]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is your favorite way to WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Courtney Patubo Kranzke </strong><strong>00:05:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started with WordPress as a personal blogger. So it continues to be my favorite way to use WordPress. But, my use has evolved to using it for work as well as a place to share my photography and food blogging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Courtney Robertson </strong><strong>00:05:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite way to WordPress is through the Training team. Most of the things that I write these days are on make.wordpress.org/training and or learn.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love teaching people about WordPress, helping people at all skill levels advance, and that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll find me around the WordPress Training team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Dustin&nbsp; Hartzler </strong><strong>00:05:59]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite way to WordPress is just building cool things. Like I have a website, my wife has a couple of websites, and me just trying to learn things and trying to do them myself. Yesterday, there was a session, a 15-minute long session, and I learned how to customize the options available for different core WordPress blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn&#8217;t realize that you could just make a button and like make a default like here&#8217;s the style for the default button. So every button&#8217;s exactly the same on the site. Like how cool is that? I like the side of customizing WordPress to make it easier for people who are non-techy like me to use my site, like my wife, and whatnot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:06:30]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you use WordPress in your day-to-day life?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Topher </strong><strong>00:06:32]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s sort of a universal tool for me. I blog, and I do podcasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I enjoy drinking whiskey, so I built a rating system for it. And I use it as a notepad, a scratch pad. I use it as my photography backup system. Just kind of as a universal tool for everything</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Alex Stine </strong><strong>00:06:53]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I currently am one of the Accessibility team reps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a core contributor, Guttenberg contributor, the occasional meta contributor, and the occasional training team contributor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:07:05]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, if that doesn&#8217;t convince you to go to a WordCamp or start your own meetup group, I just don&#8217;t know what will. Big thanks to everyone who sat down with us there in San Diego.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:23]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it&#8217;s time for our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First thing, WordPress Global Translation Day is coming up next week on September 28th. This is a great opportunity to learn more about the hard work that goes into translating all of this software for folks all around the world. If you want to learn more about how you could contribute to translations, I&#8217;ll have a link in the show notes for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that WooSesh is coming up on October 11th through 13th, 2022. This one is not an in-person event. It&#8217;s a WPSessions event, but it specifically talks about how to get some eCommerce going on your WordPress site. So if you&#8217;ve been thinking about how to get a shop on your site, or just making your current shop a bit more complicated, then this is the event for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing on our list today is All Things Open. They are hosting a hybrid event this year from October 31st through November 2nd. This event isn&#8217;t specific to WordPress, but it is specific to open source and one of the best resources for learning some OSS basics. So if you&#8217;ve been interested in learning more about how this whole open source thing is an idea that will change our generation, then set your sights on that event. I will have a link in the show notes there as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13481\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"Dropping security updates for WordPress versions 3.7 through 4.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/09/dropping-security-updates-for-wordpress-versions-3-7-through-4-0/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Sep 2022 13:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Updates\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13466\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:343:\"As of December 1, 2022 the WordPress Security Team will no longer provide security updates for WordPress versions 3.7 through 4.0.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Helping people who are new to WordPress learn how to make the most out of their CMS used to be one of the most clearly impactful things I ever did as a contributor. Whether it was making sure a brand new installation simply worked, or if the original setup needed to grow along with a solopreneur&#8217;s growing business needs, I found great joy in seeing how my local community was learning new tools together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard me talk about the Learn WP initiative or the training team on this podcast before, but you might still be a little shy to get started with the team. So I have invited one of their team reps today to talk through what the team does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. I have with us today Hauwa Abashiya. She is one of the team reps for the training team and also works on the learn.wordpress.org site. Thank you for joining me today, Hauwa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:01:33]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And thank you for having me, Josepha, quite exciting to be on your podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:37]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I, you know, when we were talking about doing this topic, I was like, you know, who would be an excellent person is Hauwa. Like you were such an interesting person to work with when we were working on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/12/simone/\">5.6 release</a>. And then also, you just have such a lovely way of explaining the complicated things that we have going on in WordPress and especially on the training side of things. And so you were the first person that came to mind for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:02:02]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of all the learn.wordpress.org things, you&#8217;ve been contributing to the WordPress project as a team rep for the training team for a bit. But that&#8217;s not really where you started. Can you tell me a bit about how you found your way to this team?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:02:15]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I started by attending a WordCamp, and that was WordCamp Brighton. And if anyone&#8217;s read my <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/finding-my-global-family/\">article on HeroPress</a>, then they will know that I learned WordPress in one week. Went through beginner sessions of it. And then, I was like, yeah, let me just go turn up and see what it&#8217;s like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So turned up, and I met some wonderful people there. One of them being <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/miss_jwo/\">Jenny Wong</a>, who introduced me to the London meetup team. So, I then went there. They were looking for volunteers because they were planning WordCamp London for 2019. And me being me, I was like, yeah, sure. Why not? And got thrown into the deep end, but no, an amazing team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got to meet some really amazing people. And yeah, just went from there then, you know, because I was doing stuff with WordCamp London, ended up going to WordCamp Europe. And I think there&#8217;s probably quite a lot of people who say they fully got into contributing in WordCamp Europe. So I was doing little bits and pieces then on like, marketing team and then met <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jessecowens/\">Jesse [Owens]</a>  at the training team cause <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">Abha Thakor</a> introduced me to him and just went from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then in terms of team rep, I mean, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/courane01/\">Courtney Robertson</a> sent out SOS, because Learn had just launched, and there were a couple of things that we needed. So that was during the soft launch. And I was like, yeah, sure. I&#8217;ll help you. I&#8217;m not doing much. And that&#8217;s how I ended up doing team rep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:46]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love that so many initial stories in the WordPress community start with like, well, I went to a WordCamp cause I was like, what in the world is this? And then people were like, we need some help. And I thought to myself, what else am I doing? Like, so many stories start that way. And I just love it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:04:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you mentioned learn.wordpress.org. That is a part of the training team in the WordPress project. Correct?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So can you give us an idea of the difference between the two? Cause like normally, with a project as big as Learn, you would expect to see like a whole separate team. But these are two intertwined teams using two intertwined concepts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so can you give us an idea of the difference between them?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:04:29]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I like to see learners, that&#8217;s the content. So it&#8217;s the content that we have on the platform, and the training team wrangles all the content on Learn. So that would be like your videos, your lesson plans, and online workshops. Yeah, so we wrangle the content that&#8217;s on there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We try to bring a lot of different teams together, and that&#8217;s one of the things the beauty, I think, of Learn is that there is a lot of cross-team collaboration, which started from the beginning and I think just will continue and get better and better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And the workshops, those are once a week, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:05:04]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So you have online workshops, which used to be called social learning spaces, which used to be called discussion groups. So those run once a week. There&#8217;s a number running, and there are some that are launching in Japan. And I think <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/bsanevans/\">Ben Evans</a> has been quite key in getting quite a lot of those going, and I think <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/piyopiyofox/\">Destiny Kanno</a> as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that&#8217;s the beauty is you get to see a lot more languages coming up. Those run once a week. And then we obviously have lesson plans, which traditionally that&#8217;s what the training team used to always make for Meetup organizers. So if you didn&#8217;t have a speaker, you could go and get a lesson plan and run through something, or anybody could pick one up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they are used mainly by like our Meetup users and then people who are running any boot camps or sessions, or you wanna just take somebody through WordPress and teach them, you can pick one up and run through it. And now we&#8217;ve got courses on Learn, which is quite exciting. Got a couple of courses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know there&#8217;s about three or four courses in development. There is a bit more WordPress development based rather than user based. There&#8217;s a fourth piece of content, and that is just the general workshop. So tutorials, I think no tutorials is what we&#8217;re calling them now. So there&#8217;s like all our online videos.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:17]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tell you terminology in any project, the age and size of WordPress is hard to keep everything straight, but especially when you&#8217;ve just changed it you&#8217;re like, what do we call it though?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:06:27]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if I understand correctly, because as you mentioned, like you have this post up on HeroPress, you don&#8217;t actually come from a training background. Like you aren&#8217;t a teacher or corporate trainer or anything, but you have really committed to contributing to the training team and to learn.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, from your perspective, from like the, I&#8217;m not a trainer perspective, what&#8217;s the most exciting thing for learn.wordpress.org in the near future?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:06:58]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s the collaboration. It&#8217;s the potential that Learn has. So I don&#8217;t have a training background, but interestingly enough, I come from Kaduna, Nigeria. And Kaduna cause all the states in Nigeria have a tagline, and, Kaduna is actually the center of learning. So there must be some link there, so yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I think the beauty of that is you don&#8217;t have to have a training background. You can come in and impart your knowledge, and there are people available in the team that can help you impart that knowledge. So if it&#8217;s like a lesson plan that you wanna draw up, we&#8217;ve got people that can help and assist in that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you wanna run an online workshop. There are people that can assist you. And I think that&#8217;s also the beauty of WordPress is that we&#8217;re all there to help each other. So just seeing that and seeing how, as time has gone on how the team has actually just been growing cause more and more people are coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then with that, you&#8217;ve got more of like the different languages coming in, and I know we might touch on that later, but it&#8217;s, I think to me, that is the beauty that anyone can actually now come in and learn. And Learn as this platform that is accessible to everybody. So it&#8217;s not necessarily behind a, like a paywall or anything, which is, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that, but there are people that it&#8217;s like, well, okay, you can access something by the community for the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:32]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think like your last thought there, something that&#8217;s by the community for the community. That&#8217;s one of the things that I noticed early on about the WordPress community. So I&#8217;ve been in the WordPress community for a long time, but when I started doing the administrative back office, things that are invisible and no one wants to know about, because it&#8217;s boring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I started doing that work, one of the things I noticed and that I really treasure the most about the WordPress community is that they want to do things together. They want to look at the problem together. They want to find a solution together. And a lot of times they just want to learn together as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We see that there is a real, I don&#8217;t know, not, it&#8217;s not a safety and numbers question. I think it is a long-standing feeling that we can all kind of get further together and that we are better together. And so I like your thought there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You mentioned, though, translations, and I know that this came up at WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don&#8217;t actually have a lot of translated content on learn.wordpress.org. There&#8217;s some technical issues that exist there, but are there a few languages that we already are sort of seeing translated courses for? Translated lessons for?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:09:47]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So we have a couple in Hindi, I believe. And I know we&#8217;ve got some Greek translations that have been coming up, so I know, I think it was last year WordCamp India, during contributor day, we had quite a lot of people translating stuff then, and I suppose the online WordCamps that we&#8217;ve been able to rank. Cause I think our first like face to face is this year, so they didn&#8217;t do that much translation there, but we&#8217;ve seen an increase in people wanting to translate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think those are the ones that come to mind. And I know Japanese, I think that was just recently, in the last two weeks, somebody&#8217;s translated one or two of the tutorials have been translated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we’re getting more and more requests coming through. And I know we kind of touched on this in our earlier discussion, but it&#8217;s like, how do you manage that? Cause you&#8217;re right, we don&#8217;t have a way to easily manage polyglots on Learn at the moment or WordPress in general. But I think seeing that, and I keep saying to people, I don&#8217;t wanna lose that engagement cause if you&#8217;ve got the people engaged, let them just do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t normally say this, but let them do it, and we&#8217;ll figure out how to sort out the whole pile when it comes in later. Because you kind of don&#8217;t want to lose them because I feel like if we say, no, we&#8217;ll wait until that comes in, we&#8217;ll lose a lot of the engagement. And come that time, people will be like, oh no, I&#8217;m not that interested. Or it might be an even more effort to try and bring more people on board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:18]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s always a struggle, like wanting to be able to get something good out without insisting that it be perfect. Like that whole perfect is the enemy of the good sort of concept.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:11:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Mm-hmm&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we were talking about this way back in June, I was like, I obviously would love to get a perfect solution out immediately, but like, you&#8217;re right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, do we just be if you don&#8217;t speak English, you cannot learn here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like that&#8217;s not fair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:11:45]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:46]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We want everyone to be able to learn here in their own languages, and yeah. That&#8217;s just a living, breathing issue with a global project, I think.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:11:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:57]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we left us on like a really juicy topic, just the lightest thing we could find. Is there anything else that you wanna be sure to share with the WordPress Briefing listeners before we head out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:12:10]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Come and join the training team. Like I said, you don&#8217;t have to be a trainer. You can come in, and help us take notes. You can come in and edit, and review. If you are a subject matter expert, we also have the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/handbook/faculty-program/\">faculty program</a>, which was launched. Was it a month ago now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorry. Days, months, weeks merge for me these days. But yeah, so that&#8217;s like a dedicated volunteer team. And in there, we&#8217;ve got content creators, editors, subject matter experts, and just admin stuff. If you wanna help us with the admin stuff. If you&#8217;re a GitHub guru, get in touch cause we are trying to automate some of our processes, and we could use the help, but yeah, just come join us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join one of our meetings, which run on Tuesdays at 7 AM UTC and 4:00 PM UTC.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, that&#8217;s right. I get my time right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:13:03]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it&#8217;s not right, we&#8217;ll put it. We&#8217;ll correct it in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, if you are not necessarily familiar with the WordPress project and how to get started with contributions, you can find the training team and a lot of information about them and all the other teams on make.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will share that in the show notes as well. make.wordpress.org/training is where you can find Hauwa&#8217;s team. Hauwa, thank you again for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:13:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, thank you for having me. It&#8217;s just a wonderful treat. I get to listen to you, and now I get to be on it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, it&#8217;s good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:13:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that some of you feel inspired to stop by and see what the team is up to learn something new about WordPress or contribute a little something yourself. And with that, I&#8217;ll bring us home with the small list of big things. First thing, there was a freshly pressed minor release last week. You probably didn&#8217;t notice it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It probably went quite smoothly in the background and never interrupted you at all. However, if you want to read what was in it, you can head to wordpress.org/news now, or click on the link in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second thing, is that coming up at the end of this week, September 9th, 2022, WordCamp US is back and ready to help broaden your WordPress knowledge. If you will be there, I hope it is a wonderful time, but if you won&#8217;t be there in person, I&#8217;ll include a link to register for the live stream, or you can watch all of those sessions afterward on wp.tv or the WordPress YouTube channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third thing on our list of small list of big things is that WordPress Translation Day is coming up. That&#8217;s normally at the end of September, it coincides with a global day of appreciation for translators just generally across the world. And so that is coming, it&#8217;s normally around the 28th or so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:55]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So put that in your calendars. As soon as I have any information, as soon as I have a link to share with you all, I will have that for you as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing on my list today is that if you are hoping to speak at WordCamp Asia, 2023, you have 10 more days, September 15th, 2022**, to apply for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need topics of all sorts, from security hardening and backend development to entrepreneurial best practices, WordPress out of the box all the way back around to the importance of securing open source freedom. Even when people don&#8217;t know they need them. If you&#8217;ve got something you&#8217;re a bit passionate about, something that you are a passionate expert about especially, we want to see your application. And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>** <em><strong>Special note: the deadline to apply as a speaker to WordCamp Asia was extended to September 30th, 2022, after the recording of this episode.</strong></em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13425\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"People of WordPress: Bud Kraus\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/08/people-of-wordpress-bud-kraus/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 21:30:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:6:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Features\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"General\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Interviews\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"HeroPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"People of WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13385\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:135:\"The latest People of WordPress story features trainer Bud Kraus, from the United States, talking about the software and how he uses it.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"webcommsat AbhaNonStopNewsUK\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14109:\"\n<p><strong>This month, as we approach <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2022/\">WordCamp US</a>, we feature Bud Kraus, a WordPress trainer who has made a career in helping others learn about software.

He was determined not to let his sight difficulties stop him from his wish to  help others learn website building and maintenance skills.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As WordPress evolves and new features release, Bud decided to extend his training services around helping new and existing users improve and practice their skills. He supports others in open source through volunteering to speak at WordPress events, and encourages others to do so too. He also gives time to help produce material for the free-to-access resource <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress,</a> which is part of the WordPress.org project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a contributor to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/\">Test</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/\">Training</a> teams, Bud is keen for others to try contributing to these areas and help support the project&#8217;s future development. One of his current training priorities is to help people with using the block editor and Full Site Editing. He is an advocate for the usability of WordPress today, saying: “I can design all aspects of a website now with a block.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Using WordPress as a traditional developer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud’s WordPress journey began with a lunch at Grand Central Station in New York in 2009. A friend and former client was promoting the idea of using WordPress, which Bud initially resisted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’m a code guy…,” he told his friend at the time. “I will never use anything like that.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the friend persisted. Eventually, Bud gave it a try and found a new approach with things called themes and plugins. His first encounter was with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/releases/\">WordPress 2.6</a>. Bud signed up with a hosting company and found a theme where he could learn to edit and understand child themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;Once I saw that you could edit anything and make it yours, I was hooked. The endorphins were freely coursing through my veins.&#8221; Bud was hooked.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Teaching WordPress strengthens your own understanding of the software</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s an old saying that the best way to learn something new is to turn around and teach someone else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud was already an instructor at the Fashion Institute of Technology when he thought, “I could teach WordPress!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so he did, packing classrooms all through those first years of WordPress as it swept through the design world and further.<br><br>But Bud had more to discover. He said: &#8220;Two big things were about to happen that were really going to change my life. They would show me the way to the WordPress community – not that I even knew what that was.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sharing lessons learnt with the WordPress community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2014, one of his students suggested he start going to the New York WordPress Meetup.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As he started going to WordCamps in New York City, he realized that WordPress was getting very large. What’s more, it had a community of people with whom he felt at home and could learn alongside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud gave a talk for the first time in 2016 at the only WordCamp to this day that has been held at the United Nations. He shared his knowledge of “Lessons Learned: Considerations For Teaching Your Clients WordPress.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"952\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-1.jpg?resize=952%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Bud Kraus talking at a WordCamp\" class=\"wp-image-13340\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-1.jpg?w=952&amp;ssl=1 952w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-1.jpg?resize=279%2C300&amp;ssl=1 279w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-1.jpg?resize=768%2C826&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 952px) 100vw, 952px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Bud Kraus speaks at WordCamps to help people use the software even more effectively</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, Bud went on to speak at other WordCamps in the US. He also volunteered as a speaker wrangler for his home camp in New York City in 2018 and 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>From speaking to writing about WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At some point before the Covid-19 lockdown, Bud found another outlet, this time in writing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud heard a magazine was advertising for submissions related to WordPress.&nbsp;His first attempted article did not make the cut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in his second submission, Bud took the risk of writing about something deeply personal – a topic he really didn’t want to write about at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He gathered his courage and revealed to the entire web design world that he was legally blind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The article appeared as&nbsp; <strong>“</strong><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/05/using-low-vision-teach-wordpress/\"><strong>Using Low Vision As My Tool To Help Me Teach WordPress</strong></a><strong>”.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"510\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/bud-kraus-2.jpg?resize=510%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Bud Kraus\" class=\"wp-image-13426\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/bud-kraus-2.jpg?w=510&amp;ssl=1 510w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/bud-kraus-2.jpg?resize=255%2C300&amp;ssl=1 255w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Bud Kraus</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the age of 37, Bud has had macular degeneration in both eyes, which affects his central vision. It is a leading cause of legal blindness in the United States and many other countries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He relies on his peripheral vision and finding ways to compensate. He also tends to see things in a flat dimension and has a difficulty discerning contrast&nbsp; &#8211; he&nbsp; is glad there are starting to be improvements in color contrasts in web design!<br><br>He uses tools like Speech to Text, larger sized cursors and bigger font sizes, and heavily uses zooming back in and out when working with WordPress. He is able to recognize patterns but has to rely on detailed preparation and memorizing materials.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his first magazine article acknowledging this situation, he shared the added difficulties that technology creates for people with visual conditions, and tips that he had found to try and find alternative routes around them. He uses the technique of finding alternatives in his training work to help people learn and understand, realizing that all people have different ways of reading and understanding. His words and subsequent stories have inspired others and enabled more people to highlight accessibility. He describes himself as a ‘stakeholder in ensuring that the WordPress admin is accessible.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year after its first publication, the piece became a WordCamp talk, ‘My Way with WordPress.’ The talk was a hit and started many conversations about accessibility and the importance of raising awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months later, he gave a Gutenberg talk at the first WordCamp Montclair. There was no way he could have done it from a laptop, so instead, he did it from his 27” desktop computer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud said: &#8220;It was a presentation on Gutenberg plugins. Since I couldn’t do this from a notebook screen (the screen is too small and the keyboard is hard for me to manipulate), it was decided that I would bring in my 27″ desktop machine to a WordCamp. I’m probably the first person to ever have done this. It was good thing I only lived a few miles away.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “I sat behind my computer, did my thing, and every once in a while peered out to make sure people were still there.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Different ways of contributing to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main ways Bud supported the community around the software was through talks at WordCamps and helping others to speak. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, he was keen to continue contributing when WordCamps were no longer meeting in person.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing: the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today is one of my favorite niche holidays &#8211; World Wide Web Day &#8211; which serves to raise awareness about the origins of the World Wide Web project. WordPress, as part of Web 2.0, only ever had a chance to exist because the web, as we have come to know it exists. So in order to mark this nerdy day on the WP Briefing, I invited a number of community members to share a bit about how WordPress has been a part of their lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first, let&#8217;s do some introductions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Warner 00:01:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/awarner20/\">Adam Warner</a>, and I&#8217;m originally from a small town in west Michigan, now residing in Orlando, Florida.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alice Orrù 00:01:15]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/aliceorru/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/aliceorru/\">Alice Orrù</a>. I&#8217;m Italian. I was born in the beautiful island of Sardinia, but I&#8217;ve been living in Spain in the province of Barcelona for 10 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Dee Teal 00:01:26]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/thewebprincess/\">Dee Teal</a>; Dee is short for Denise. I&#8217;m from New Zealand, but I live In Melbourne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Femy Praseeth 00:01:33]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, my name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/femkreations/\">Femy Praseeth</a>. I was born and raised in India and now live in San Jose, California, with my family and cuddly Doodle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jill Binder 00:01:41]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jillbinder/\">Jill Binder</a>, and I&#8217;ve just moved back to Vancouver, Canada.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Mary Job 00:01:47]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/mariaojob/\">Mary Job</a>. I&#8217;ve been using WordPress since 2015, and I&#8217;m from Nigeria. I&#8217;m from the Western part of Nigeria. Ijebu precisely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Oneal Rosero 00:01:57]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/onealtr/\">Oneal Rosero</a>. I am from the Philippines and I&#8217;ve been using WordPress since 2007.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Theophilus Adegbohungbe</strong> <strong>00:02:06]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you. My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/iamsirotee/\">Theophilus Adegbohungbe</a> . And I&#8217;m from Ilesa, Osun State in Nigeria.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Ugyen Dorji 00:02:14]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ugyensupport/\">Ugyen Dorji</a> and I&#8217;m from Bhutan. And I&#8217;m working with WordPress for more than five years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:22]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I enjoy the most about being part of any community is being able to see how people change and grow over time as they learn and gain confidence in their own expertise. So a favorite early question is naturally, ‘How has WordPress changed your World?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alice Orrù 00:02:37]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress changed my world in many ways. But, uh, starting from the moment, it allowed me to become part of a global connected and welcome community. I started using WordPress as a blogger many, many years ago, but it was in 2015 that I started working behind the scenes of WordPress with a plugin company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was the moment when everything changed, basically, because I realized that WordPress was much more than a CMS for creating websites. It was a world full of opportunities for networking, making new friends and walking a new professional path as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Ugyen Dorji 00:03:15]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>During one interview, I was asked many questions about WordPress and although I had a basic understanding of WordPress, I struggled to give detailed answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that interview, I resolved to develop my skills and learn as much about WordPress as possible. A few months passed and I received a call from ServeMask In, [who] had developed a plugin called All-in-One WP Migration plugin. They offered me a position which fulfilled my wish to work with WordPress full time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because of that, I am now an active contributor to the WordPress community as bread and butter, with the best career in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Theophilus Adegbohungbe 00:04:03]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are very familiar with my country, Nigeria things here, it&#8217;s not as smooth as it is in other parts of the world. That is, when you are done in school in my university, you have to find means of surviving yourself.&nbsp; There is nothing like the government have work for you. There is nothing like you finish our institution and you get job instantly. So it&#8217;s very tough here. And, year by year, schools keep producing graduates with no companies to employ them and no government job again as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I personally, I was able to gain freedom from this with the help of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Femy Praseeth 00:04:51]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress completely changed my work life. I started working independently. I started freelancing with agencies and designers and, uh, building websites from their web designs. And this was around the time my son was born. Actually, he was in elementary school and I think this was around 2014 or so. I started working remotely when remote was not even a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there were very few companies that let you work from home and remote was not a mainstream thing at all, but with WordPress, I could set my own working hours while my son was in school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:29]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, my preferred follow-up question of, ‘How did you hear about us?’ or ‘How did you connect to this global community?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Oneal Rosero 00:05:36]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, actually what I love about WordPress is that it&#8217;s a community. It&#8217;s not a business. It&#8217;s not a company. It&#8217;s a community. It&#8217;s a community that&#8217;s always ready to help support, teach and encourage people. That&#8217;s how I felt when I joined the community. There&#8217;s always somebody who has your back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s always somebody who&#8217;s going to guide you. There&#8217;s always an expert who will take your hand and lead you into the beauty that is WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Warner 00:06:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way that I connect with the global community these days are one, of course, is .org Slack. Another of course is Twitter as there&#8217;s a very active WordPress community there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then with WordCamps all over the globe. I&#8217;m lucky enough to have been able to travel to several hundred WordCamps through the years in the US and abroad. And that&#8217;s one of the most rewarding parts is meeting people from all over the world and you see really how small and the world really is and how similar we really all are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Theophilus Adegbohungbe 00:06:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, not until 2020. I don’t know if you know this lady, a very vibrant lady in WordPress. She&#8217;s from Nigeria; her name is Mary Job, and she&#8217;s really promoting WordPress here. So it was through her that I got to know about the community. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jill Binder 00:06:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My work is the global WordPress community. So we hold our three programs for the global WordPress community, and we are always trying to reach more and more countries. For quite a while, it was very North America-heavy, and then I made some efforts to expand. And it&#8217;s very exciting that this year, some contributors in our team have actually launched an Asia Pacific branch of our group.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we have two meetings every other week where we have the America/Europe and the APAC, and we&#8217;ve also been able to reach other countries as well, but we typically reach something like between 20 and 50 countries a year, depending on the year. So a hundred percent global. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>How has WordPress, either the CMS or the project, made you feel more connected? And are there any surprising connections that came from WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Dee Teal&nbsp; 00:07:47]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess the surprising connections I think that have come from WordPress have been the fact that I feel like I&#8217;ve got friends all over the world. And a lot of those have come out of community involvement and from contributing. That I could go to a, a meetup pretty much anywhere in the world and probably find somebody I know, or at least a second degree connection of somebody that I haven&#8217;t, you know, that I might not have met, but know somebody that I know. And certainly that happens fairly regularly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Mary Job 00:08:13]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress. The WordPress project, the community, has made me feel connected in a huge way, because I am literally surrounded by everything WordPress. So I like how, when you meet somebody who does WordPress, there&#8217;s this instant, ‘Oh, we&#8217;re brothers,’ or&nbsp; ‘Oh, we&#8217;re sisters!’ You know? There&#8217;s that feeling? That&#8217;s how I feel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when I see somebody who does WordPress, as I do, I&#8217;m like, ‘Oh yeah, we&#8217;re, kin.’ You know? We are family. That&#8217;s how I feel when I meet people who do WordPress. And I&#8217;ve met quite a number of people who do WordPress from like around the world. Like I have a friend here, he&#8217;s from the Benin Republic, and we host started a dinner on Friday night and one of my guests was asking me, ‘How did you guys meet?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was like, ‘Oh yeah, we work in the same WordPress ecosystem.’ He attended our WordCamp, we became friends, and we just literally became really good friends. So I have tons of people that I&#8217;ve met like that I hold in high esteem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Ugyen Dorji 00:09:12]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress Meetups are the seeds that lead to the growth of WordPress communities. WordCamp is a platform for plugin and theme developers to meet WordPress users and website developers. It&#8217;s a great environment where many incredible discussions about WordPress takes place. With each WordCamp there is a &#8220;tribe&#8221; meeting, where I think people [can] get more connected. It&#8217;s a fantastic opportunity for aspiring computer engineers, generators and get to showcase their talent and meet each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alice Orrù 00:09:51]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the project level, it has given me the opportunity to feel like an active part of a global project. The idea that I can give my contribution to making the web a better place &#8211; it’s amazing. And I do so with the Translation team, so making WordPress accessible to all the people that use the core plugins and themes in Italian, and prefer to do that in Italian.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:18]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What area of the WordPress world is most important to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jill Binder 00:10:21]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a little bit of a passion for diversity in tech and diversity in WordPress, specifically around events. And so, here&#8217;s a chance to name the three programs that we&#8217;ve been working on this year. So as mentioned a few times, we have our <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/diversity-speaker-training-workshop/\">Diverse Speaker Workshop</a> that helps people go from not even having the thought that people could step up on stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the second program is because of the pandemic. There was no longer the straight path from taking our workshop to speaking, because we used to hold them or people used to hold them for their WordCamps and meetups. And so it was like, okay, you&#8217;ve taken. Apply for our next WordCamp or meetup. But during the pandemic, that wasn&#8217;t a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have this amazing channel that we welcome everyone to join, allies and people from underrepresented groups who are interested in speaking or interested in supporting people and speaking. And that&#8217;s the Diverse Speaker channel <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C028SE81N3H\">diverse-speaker-support</a> channel on the Make WordPress slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third program is, and we, we went through a name change recently. So I&#8217;ll try to remember the new change it&#8217;s Organizing Inclusive and Diverse WordPress Events. And this is for WordCamp and meetup organizers to learn. We&#8217;ve learned over the last couple years, how important it is to create inclusive spaces and be good allies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how do we actually do that? And a few of us created a very action oriented workshop in 2019 for WCUS, and that is now the basis of the work that we are bringing to people and people are loving it.. We&#8217;ve had people report a 40%, self-report 40%, increase in feeling prepared to create an inclusive event from before and after taking that workshop, which is super cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So, that’s my passion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Oneal Rosero 00:12:13]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really love helping the WP Diversity team. I love running the workshops. I love running the workshops for myself, because I used to do training for software back before the pandemic. I used to train up to a thousand people a year in person, sometimes like 500 people in a room at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But of course I had to shift. I had to pivot to online training, which is what the training team has brought for me. And the focus on the diversity. I like running the workshops. I like running workshops for different groups, different countries, because it&#8217;s nice to meet new people. It&#8217;s nice to hear about their culture, about the limitations that people have in Africa with connectivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they, they resort to using WhatsApp on their phone in order to do a meetup. That&#8217;s how they do their, their meetings, their discussions. It&#8217;s unlike other countries where we can do video calls. They have to use their mobile phones because connectivity isn&#8217;t accessible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Places like in the Philippines that get affected when it starts to rain a little bit, we lose our internet. So we have backups and our backups have backups. So there are many things that you learn that are different when you&#8217;re living in the city, when you&#8217;re living in the provinces, in the country. So it&#8217;s so many things that you learn about people and how they&#8217;re able to adapt.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Warner 00:13:35]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enabling end users to reach their goals. And whether that means participating in contributing to the software, to the Core software itself, in terms of UI/UX usability. That can include participating in the community and sharing your knowledge proactively with users who may be new to the platform, or have used WordPress for a while, but now want to step up their game, get a little deeper into using their websites as a tool for growth, for whatever business that they&#8217;re in. So, I mean, overall, the, the most important part of the WordPress world to me are the end users. And, you know, there, there is this quote unquote inner circle of WordPress community people. People who are involved in .org, people who contribute to the software, people who contribute to the 20 plus make.wordpress.org teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those we have to keep in mind, are not the average user by and far. They are not the typical user that hears the word WordPress and then goes out and searches it and then has to figure out how to use it. So I think user experience is probably the most important part for me and making sure that any of that innate knowledge that we have in that inner circle of WordPress because many of us have been using it for so long, keeping in mind that is not the norm. And it&#8217;s not the scale at which WordPress is used and, and making sure we translate complex concepts down to a layperson&#8217;s terms that might not be as familiar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:17]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that I have always found so fascinating about the web and WordPress’ role in it is how it has made the world simultaneously smaller and bigger. By giving voices to the voiceless we help each other find our community niches regardless of where they are in the world. Some of your closest friends could be people you would never meet in your own neighborhood. Well, let’s hear what some of our community members had to say about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Dee Tea 00:15:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the thing that has been most empowering is, is coming into the project either in terms of contributing time and efforts to the community, which is where most of my contribution has been &#8211; has always been about this is a really cool thing, and I really want to build this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I&#8217;ll put my time and efforts into building WordPress. Not for me, but because I see its value and I see its community and I see that the contribution that it&#8217;s making to the world and I, and that&#8217;s really important. But finding that on the other side of that was a huge amount of personal benefit for me in my career, in the friendships that I&#8217;ve made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I feel like if I had been approaching the community with, I want a better career, I wanna meet all of these people and I want, and I want all of this. From, “I want” for me, instead of, I want for this project, for the community and effectively for the world with that, you know, that whole democratized, the democratizing of publishing is this thing that serves the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s been the key for me is that I absolutely have reaped amazing benefits from it, but it came out of that sense of, I see this value here and I want to contribute to that because it&#8217;s gonna have value, not just for me, but for a whole slew of people. And so, uh, you know, for much, much bigger impact than just on me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think that&#8217;s the important thing for me is that sense of, if you approach it with that attitude of what can I do to help? It&#8217;s amazing what you will find yourself helped with in return.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:17:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that you enjoyed this tour of WordPress in the World Wide Web. I want to share a big thank you to all of the folks who contributed to our little WordPress Briefing celebration of World Wide Web Day today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. So firstly, we&#8217;ve got a couple of updates from our upcoming flagship events. WordCamp US has announced a speaker support fund specifically for historically underrepresented speakers at the event. You can donate to the fund on the page if you&#8217;d like, and there are also directions on how to request support, if you are part of an underrepresented group.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the folks over at WordCamp Asia, the call for speakers is live. That&#8217;s taking place in February, 2023. But it&#8217;s never too early to brush up those presentations and get them submitted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next big thing is that there are some changes coming to the WordPress mobile app. A lot of the Jetpack functionality will be removed from it, so this is going to have a little bit of an effect on daily users of the app, but it will also have an effect on regular contributors. I&#8217;ll have a link to the full write up in the show notes so that you don&#8217;t have to guess or hold it all in your memory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, this excellent design that you see on wordpress.org/news is finally making its way out to the next parts of the wordpress.org website. Before you know, it, there will be a fresh looking homepage as well as few other pages and then… to infinity and beyond (or something like that).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And next up I&#8217;ll be taking just a mid-year break from the podcast. And so the next time that I actually see you again, will be in September.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13198\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"People of WordPress: Carla Doria\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/07/people-of-wordpress-carla-doria/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 31 Jul 2022 19:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:6:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Features\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"General\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Interviews\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"HeroPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"People of WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13201\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:324:\"In this series, we share some of the inspiring stories of how WordPress and its global network of contributors can change people’s lives for the better.

This month we feature Carla Doria, a customer support specialist from South America on how WordPress opened up a new world for her, and gave her the ability to help the local community</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Carla, working with WordPress is a vital part of her life. It gave her a career and a community, in which she she would organize the first WordCamp in her city, Cochabamba, and the first in Bolivia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla studied industrial engineering and has a master’s degree in environmental studies.<br>Her first experience with WordPress was when she decided to start a small business designing and selling cushions and bedclothes.&nbsp;While Carla sat in the small store she had rented, hoping that people stopping at the shop windows would step in to buy something, she decided she needed to create a website.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>First steps with WordPress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla had no budget to hire somebody, but she felt confident&nbsp; she could learn things on her own.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“Learning to use WordPress requires no code skills or a technical background. It needs an adventurous and playful spirit.” </p><cite>Carla Doria</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>She had always been studious, and decided she would figure out how to build a website herself. Carla ended up building a simple blog with WordPress. At the time, she didn’t even have a budget to buy a custom domain, so she used a free subdomain.<br><br>“Learning to use WordPress is easy. It requires no code skills or a technical background at all. It only needs an adventurous and playful spirit,” said Carla</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were no profits, and any income mainly went to pay the store’s rent. At the time, her previous company contacted her for a job opening that matched her profile. Carla needed that income and decided to closed the store and forget about being an entrepreneur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in employee mode, Carla started her new job as a technical writer for a software development company. Since Carla had completed her master’s degree in the UK, she was proficient in English. Her close affinity for computers and technology made it easy for her to translate complex software jargon into simple tutorial steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Carla got more interested in technical writing and started to improve her writing skills. This reconnected her with her previous enthusiasm for writing, and she decided to channel that interest into a blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Diving deep</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating her blog helped her become more familiar with WordPress and building websites. In 2015, Carla blogged about writing, her thoughts, book reviews, and everything that came to mind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through looking for answers to specific issues using her WordPress blog, Carla found the support forums a useful place to go. Soon she realized that she could also help answer other people’s questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-2.jpg?resize=600%2C900&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13189\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-2.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-2.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla began checking the forums as a hobby. She liked that she was able to help people and learn more while doing so. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of surfing social media during her work breaks, Carla focused on checking the WordPress forums. Through this she learnt about a support job in one of the global firms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She felt the job was made for her and was excited to support people in building their websites with WordPress. The role offered the possibility to work remotely and travel while still working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After three years as a technical writer, her career felt stuck. She was certain she did not want to return to any job related to industrial engineering. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla did not get through the selection process the first time. But after nearly 18 months between three applications and learning HTML and CSS, Carla finally secured a support job in 2016. With this job, WordPress became her main source of income.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Leading a local WordPress community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On the job, Carla learned about the WordPress communities around the world and WordCamps. But when somebody asked about the WordPress community where Carla lived, she didn’t know what to say. Was there a community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She discovered no local group existed, so she researched what was needed to setup a meetup. Carla discussed the idea with others, but hesitated as she thought it would require an expert WordPress developer to organize.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But after trying to gauge interest, Carla realized that the only way to find community members was to start a community. In 2017, the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Cochabamba-WordPress-Meetup/\">WordPress community in Cochabamba</a> was born.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"684\" height=\"391\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/Comunidad_WP_Cochabamba_FSE_event2022.jpg?resize=684%2C391&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"The theme preview screen in the WordPress Cochabamba meeting on creating your website with blocks.\" class=\"wp-image-13236\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/Comunidad_WP_Cochabamba_FSE_event2022.jpg?w=684&amp;ssl=1 684w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/Comunidad_WP_Cochabamba_FSE_event2022.jpg?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>WordPress meeting in Cochabamba explored creating your website with blocks</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The group has had ups and downs, probably similar to any other community. Although Cochabamba is not a big city, they had issues finding a location that was free and available to anyone who wanted to join. People came with different levels of knowledge, from people with&nbsp;vast experience with WordPress to people with no experience but who wanted to learn.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community grew during the pandemic, as meetups went online and people from other cities in Bolivia were able to attend. After restrictions were lifted, there was a lot of excitement amongst members to meet each other in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Giving back through speaking</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-1.jpg?resize=600%2C900&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Carla reading a book under a tree\" class=\"wp-image-13191\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-1.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The community also helped Carla to develop a new skill in public speaking. She applied to be a speaker at WordCamp Mexico <a href=\"https://mexicocity.wordcamp.org/2019/\">2019</a> and <a href=\"https://mexicocity.wordcamp.org/2020/\">2020</a>, <a href=\"https://guayaquil.wordcamp.org/2019/\">WordCamp Guayaquil 2019</a>, and <a href=\"https://colombia.wordcamp.org/2020/\">WordCamp Colombia in 2020</a>. Her confidence grew while she enjoyed connecting with other communities and meeting people who were on similar pathways. Not all of them were developers, as she had presumed. Many, like her, started out as bloggers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"977\" height=\"419\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?resize=977%2C419&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"WordCamp Cochabamba\'s logo with blue and grey lettering and a hat\" class=\"wp-image-13228\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?w=977&amp;ssl=1 977w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?resize=300%2C129&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?resize=768%2C329&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, after three years, Carla applied to organize her first WordCamp in 2021 in <a href=\"https://cochabamba.wordcamp.org/2021/\">Cochabamba</a>. She had never imagined organizing any WordCamp, and through this having the experience to talk to sponsors and contact companies, and lead a group of people with different talents and backgrounds. Carla felt she had learnt so much from the experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to WordPress, Carla found a job she enjoyed, was able to work remotely, and help build something in her community to help people learn skills and find career opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla feels grateful for all she has been able to do thanks to WordPress. She said: “WordPress has led me to find good jobs.

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is an open source software project and, like many other open source software projects, has an entire community of people who show up to help improve it however they can. Most of you probably use WordPress every day in some way. And I&#8217;m going to assume that since you listen to this podcast, you&#8217;re also interested in how this all works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I mention practically every episode is that WordPress works and continues to work because of generous contributions from people all around the world. I consider my work with WordPress to be my way of giving back for everything that this software enabled me and my family to do. But I once was a first-time contributor, and I remember what it felt like before I knew everything.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I felt like it moved at the speed of light and that I could never tell what to do now, let alone what to do next. And that everyone around me basically already knew everything. And if you are feeling that way right now, I encourage you to take a big deep breath [breathe] and let me help you get started.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:43]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a roadmap sort of person. So I&#8217;m going to start by sharing the stages I&#8217;ve observed for folks who are contributing to open source. That way, you can tell where you are right now, which spoiler alert is probably a bit further along than you realize. Then I&#8217;ll give you some questions you can ask yourself for each stage to figure out what is a good fit for you. Think of it as a guided exploration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, the five stages. So these are they:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Connecting</strong>. That&#8217;s when you&#8217;re first learning about the community. You know WordPress exists, but now you&#8217;ve just discovered that the community exists. That&#8217;s where you are.&nbsp;</li><li>The second phase is <strong>Understanding</strong>. It&#8217;s when you are researching the community, like, you know it exists, you think you want to give back, and so you&#8217;re trying to figure out where everything is.&nbsp;</li><li>The third phase is what I call <strong>Engaging</strong>. It&#8217;s when you&#8217;re first interacting, you&#8217;ve downloaded the CMS, you have figured out which team you think you&#8217;re interested in, and you&#8217;re headed to events or meetings or whatever.&nbsp;</li><li>The fourth stage is one that I refer to as <strong>Performing</strong>. And that&#8217;s when you&#8217;ve decided that you&#8217;re gonna volunteer and you&#8217;re gonna take some action. You&#8217;re going to like a contributor day or running a release or whatever. I think that&#8217;s probably not the first place you land, running a release is probably a lot, but, you know, coordinating work on the release or something like that.&nbsp;</li><li>And then phase five, which is the <strong>Leading</strong> phase. That&#8217;s when you&#8217;re taking responsibility for things getting done.&nbsp;</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:08]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get any further, there are four important things to remember about those stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing to remember is that there is no set time between any of those stages. You can start in one and then three years later go to the next one, or you can start in one and go into the next stage tomorrow. The next thing to know is that each stage builds on the one before it. In my observation, anytime I have seen a contributor who feels like they&#8217;re really struggling, it&#8217;s because they skipped a stage in there, which really causes some trouble for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing to remember is that not everyone will make it through these stages, which is okay. The majority of the community stops at three. Most contributors stop at four. And that is perfectly fine. That is expected. That is normal and completely in line with what we expect from contribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, and the final thing to remember about that list of the phases is that very few people make it into that leadership stage. If we assume, like I do, that 1% of the people who are using WordPress also show up and contribute back to WordPress, then it&#8217;s kind of safe to assume also that about 1% of those people who have shown up to contribute to WordPress are moving into a space where they feel like they&#8217;re willing to take responsibility for making sure things get done in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:31]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like we all collectively feel responsible for WordPress&#8217;s success, but in that leadership area, you&#8217;re kind of taking responsibility for 40% of the web or whatever&#8217;s going on there. And not a lot of people make it there, and that is completely fine, too. So that&#8217;s our basic terminology today. Those are the caveats that go with our basic terminology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most difficulties that arise for new contributors happen because a stage got skipped somewhere along the way. It&#8217;s almost never intentional, but from what I&#8217;ve observed, that&#8217;s what makes it really difficult to get started and what makes it difficult to keep going once you&#8217;ve kind of already gotten in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, all right. Big breath, folks with me again [breathe]. Alright, it&#8217;s guided exploration time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First phase, the connecting phase. Remember, this is where you&#8217;ve just learned the community exists, people are talking about it, you don&#8217;t know much more. The first step for you is asking yourself what it is you could do. Or if there&#8217;s a project out there that looks particularly interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:36]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can ask yourself questions, like, am I a writer? And if I am a writer, do I write technical or prose. The other thing you can ask is, am I a PHP developer, a JavaScript developer, Python, Go; which language am I writing in because I find it most beautiful. Another thing you can ask yourself is, am I a teacher or a mentor, or do I just generally like to be a mighty helper? And I like to make sure that things keep running.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So once you&#8217;ve asked yourself those things, it&#8217;s on to phase two, the understanding phase. This is when you&#8217;re looking around at this new-to-you community to see what is happening where. So you take a look at the teams that are around, you think about whatever it was you said you were good at in the last question and you look at which teams might be a good fit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you said that you&#8217;re a good technical writer, then Docs probably is for you. Have you been training others to use WordPress for years? Then you might wanna look into Training. There are a lot of other things, obviously, like if you think you&#8217;re good at working with code PHP or JavaScript, you&#8217;re probably gonna end up in Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are particularly good at any of the other tech stacks that we have around in our Trac area or an Openverse, then that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll land over there. You have design options. Like if design is really your thing, we have a Design team, but we also have a Themes team. There are plenty of places that you can land depending on what it is that you feel like you are the best at and could really help the WordPress project. And so that&#8217;s your phase two.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you have gotten a good guess at a team, we&#8217;re gonna swing through to phase three, which is the engaging phase. This is the phase that is the scariest for most people, but it&#8217;s okay. I am here for you. I am here for you in this podcast. So you have figured out what you want to do in order to contribute, and you&#8217;ve got a sense for the team that looks right. There are two things that you do next.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:34]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One is that you can go to a meeting. There are many kinds of meetings. There are team meetings, bug scrubs, and testing sessions, but they&#8217;re all in Slack, which means that you can attend one from anywhere. When they kick off, you wave, you introduce yourself, you let everybody know that you&#8217;re there and you&#8217;re observing. Folks will welcome you and just kind of give you some concept of what they&#8217;re working on. Easy as that. You&#8217;ve done your first time meeting attendance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another good option is to keep an eye out for specific events. Some of those events happen online, like Global Translation Day. But also some of them happen in person like, Meetups or WordCamps. And there again, you show up, you wave, you introduce yourself, see if you can make a connection or two, let people know that you&#8217;re new and you&#8217;re just trying to figure out where you are and what you wanna do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve made it now, all the way to phase four, the performing phase, then give yourself a little pat on the back! Figuring out where you want to go and who your friendly faces are is the biggest challenge when you get started. So congratulations!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:37]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phase four is the phase where you&#8217;ve decided you&#8217;re brave enough to volunteer &#8211; to do some contribution. You&#8217;re volunteering your time. That&#8217;s where you are now. So oddly enough, you start this phase by assigning yourself something, assigning yourself, a task. This seems counterintuitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s this feeling that you can&#8217;t say that you&#8217;re gonna do something. That you can&#8217;t just assign something to yourself and say that you&#8217;re gonna do it. But in open source projects, you always can. You find a task where you&#8217;re comfortable, and you just mention that you would like to give it a try while the team is having their weekly meeting. And it&#8217;s simple as that. And not big things either. Like organizing an event or maintaining a component, those are probably too big for your first time around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m talking things like, &#8216;I will test that patch that you mentioned in the meeting.&#8217; Or &#8216;I will review the docs and make sure that they&#8217;re up to date with the most recent release.&#8217; Or &#8216;I can help run meetings for the next release.&#8217;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you have phase five, where you just repeat phase four until you are leading something! And I don&#8217;t mean leading in the 1950s sort of way, where you have like a corner office and you&#8217;re ordering people around. I mean, in the warm, inviting millennial way where you&#8217;re leading by inspiring people to do something or you&#8217;re leading because you make sure that the meeting happens every single week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you&#8217;re leading because you added screenshots to tickets that needed testing and so you moved something forward in a way that was helpful. Easy peasy. You can go to your first contributor today or a WordPress Slack meeting and just be a contributor by the time you leave, right? You might feel like ‘easy as that isn&#8217;t quite the right set of words right there. And as a matter of fact, you might be thinking to yourself, this woman is just plain wrong. It could not possibly be that easy. And I agree. It really isn&#8217;t literally quote-unquote just that easy. Just like handing someone a notebook and a pen will not instantly make them an award-winning novelist, handing someone a wordpress.org profile and credentials to Slack won&#8217;t instantly make them a contributor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For both of those examples, what makes someone good is the ability to try and fail and still be encouraged to try again. So if it&#8217;s been a while since you contributed and you&#8217;re thinking about returning, or if you&#8217;ve been listening to me for a while and you&#8217;re ready to give this contribution thing a try, I hope this helps you to feel brave enough to try and brave enough to fail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I encourage you to be brave enough to try again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:20]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at our small list of big things. My friends, we have a Performance team. This team has been a working group for a long time and is focused on some deep, inner workings of WordPress and its surrounding ecosystem to make sure that we are as fast and slick as possible. You can check them out on make.wordpress.org/performance, their brand new site, and see when they&#8217;re meeting, what they&#8217;re aiming to get into the WordPress 6.1 release, and if that&#8217;s something that you would like to contribute to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that there&#8217;s a brand new call out for testing. This time it&#8217;s focused on templates and retroactively applying them to an entire category of posts. So it&#8217;s a little bit workflow testing, a little bit technology testing, and we could really use your help in bug hunting for both of those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing is that you know since contribution is obviously the focus of today&#8217;s podcast, we are looking for table leads for WordCamp US’ contributor day that&#8217;s coming up in September. There&#8217;s a whole blog post about it, I&#8217;ll link to it in the show notes so that you&#8217;ll have all the info and can raise your hand if you want.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:12:25]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of things that I&#8217;ll have in the show notes, I also am going to put like a contributor quizlet guide thing. If the guided, figuring out of the teams in the phase two section, if that didn&#8217;t make any sense to you and you just need something to direct you specifically to potential teams, I&#8217;m gonna link to the contributor kind of sorting hat quiz that came out with WordCamp Europe.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I&#8217;m talking about Five for the Future– again. Before we get stuck right into the heart of it, 10 episodes ago, in episode 25, I focused on the Five for the Future initiative and I recommend that you listen to that before you join me in today&#8217;s episode. It&#8217;s only eight minutes and it gives you a history of the Five for the Future initiative, as well as some information on the Five for the Future program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It then goes on to talk about some of the original intentions behind that original initiative. The reason I bring this back up today is partially because one, I will talk about both the program and the initiative it&#8217;s based on literally anytime. I believe strongly that they are both a vital part of what will result in a triumph of the commons of WordPress, and keep this empowering project around for years to come.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also bring it up today because there&#8217;s conversation about a post I published a couple of months back that has generated some dialogue around the intentions of this catchy call to contribution. So to make sure that as we move through this discussion together, we are working with as much factual information as possible, I present to you some facts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First and foremost, the pillars of this initiative. The 5% in Five for the Future is aspirational. Contribution to open source is a question and indication of privilege. So the 5% is not a requirement, but rather it&#8217;s an aim. It could refer to 5% of your time or 5% of your resources, or just any amount of your time or resources around. Regardless of how you&#8217;re defining it, it is an aspiration, not a requirement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second pillar, pledges show your intention and whatever contributions you are able to offer after you&#8217;ve made your pledge are always welcome. No one is out there checking for 100% completion of the hours that you intended to give back to WordPress versus the hours that you actually succeeded at giving back to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many volunteers that make sure that this project is running and functional and has plenty of people knowing how to get things done and how to teach others how to get things done. It&#8217;s all coming from generosity of heart.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:52]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of generosity, the third thing that is important about this initiative is that it insists on and wants to celebrate a culture of generosity. Beyond the concept of a pledge, is the idea of generous collaboration toward the long term health and stability of our project for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As contributors, we understand that we are greater than the sum of our parts and what we build <em>within</em> WordPress empowers those who build <em>with</em> WordPress. So those are the pillars that went into that initial thought, that opening Five for the Future call to action that Matt gave to everybody in 2014.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so now I want to share with you some of the pillars of the program that has grown up around it. So the Five for the Future initiative, if you&#8217;re not familiar, was started in 2014 and is a grand call to all of us to remember to give back to the shared commons of WordPress. Its aim was to help guard against what is called the “tragedy of the commons,” where resources are continually taken out and not necessarily reinvested in. No one&#8217;s necessarily putting anything back into those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:06]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the starting point for all of this. So the program, the Five for the Future program, in 2018 was built as a collaborative effort with full participation and buy-in from the contributors who were active in the project at the time. It allowed anyone to raise their hands, to show support of WordPress via a pledge and also started a multi-year discussion of how to define contributions in a way that let us automatically provide props and therefore more effectively put badges on people&#8217;s wordpress.org profiles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then in 2019, there was an additional pilot of the program, which kind of offered some team structure, which was intended to not only take on work that I don&#8217;t like to ask volunteers to do, but also to provide some checks and balances to an absolute raft of sponsored contributor hours that we had started to see show up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us then to the post that I mentioned at the start. Knowledgeable supporters of the WordPress open source project have debated next iterations to Five for the Future activity and programming. So, to bring the conversation to a central set of questions, or rather to bring the conversation to a central spot, I raised these two questions. One, what activities can we see inside our contributor networks? So wordpress.org, make.wordpress.org, the Rosetta sites that we have, Slack, et cetera.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:30]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what activities can we see inside the contributor networks that we can flag to enable easier distribution of props and therefore badges? The second question is, what activities can we see also in those contributor networks that appear to be contributions, but in the end are only benefiting the person or company that provides the contributions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For what it&#8217;s worth that discussion then also raised a third question that I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve even started to tackle, which is what about the activities that are not in the contributor network, but still do move WordPress forward? Cause there are so, so many of those things and it&#8217;s a great question. I don&#8217;t have an answer and just so that I don&#8217;t leave you all with a series of questions for which there are no answers provided in this particular podcast, I do have a few answers for questions that I have seen floating around this discussion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first question is actually a bunch of questions. There are like three parts to it. What are props, who gives props, and who tracks them? So ‘props’ is a term used in WordPress to describe shared recognition of a contribution. Think of it as like a hat tip or kudos or an assist. However you think about it, it&#8217;s recognition of the other people who helped to solve a problem along the way. That is what props are.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:47]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second part of that question is who gives props and historically developers have given props, which tends to mean that it&#8217;s mostly developers who get props. But now, also, any team rep during a release cycle can provide props to folks on their team, volunteers on their team who were really helpful during the course of the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And recently we also added the functionality for ad hoc props to be given in the Slack props channel, and those get added to your profile activity. So that someone can give you basically a public thanks for having helped on something that they were working on. And then that gets logged in your activity tracker on your WordPress.org profile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final question in that first big question is who tracks these props? And the answer is human beings! Which is why folks feel like they have to do a ton of things before they even get props. And that&#8217;s also why I&#8217;d like to automate more and more of them so that you don&#8217;t have to do a ton of things in order for someone to show up and acknowledge that you are part of a solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:51]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the second question that I&#8217;ve seen kind of running around is, where do props start? And that is a great question that has been asked year after year. And one that I think we should continue to ask. The reality is that we won&#8217;t be able to see every contribution to WordPress, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they aren&#8217;t valuable. And it doesn&#8217;t mean that they don&#8217;t matter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building our culture of generosity helps us to better recognize and celebrate each other for all of our contributions, whether they are for a major release or a major event, or one of these new ad hoc props that you can offer to people. And if we see more and more of the same type of contributions being celebrated, then we can also work toward automating those as well, so that you don&#8217;t have to do a super ton of them before someone has noticed that you&#8217;ve done even one of them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third big question that has been running around is, what about the people who don&#8217;t want the props? If people want to be literally anonymous, then deletion requests are probably your way to go. But I actually don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the question here. I think the question is what if a prop holds no intrinsic value to you and then, you know, I wanna thank you for that spirit of generosity. And I also wanna say that I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:02]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully, all of these answers clarify what lies at the heart of what is intended with the Five for the Future initiative and the program that&#8217;s built on top of it. And why I care so much about fixing the ways we offer props to folks. For me, it&#8217;s not about assessing the worthiness of people or companies or any of their contributions. For me, it&#8217;s about reinvesting in the shared commons of the WordPress ecosystem, by finding a way that our economy can entice folks to put back into WordPress, something close to the benefit that they receive from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. Thank you all for making it into the final stretches with me. These three things that I&#8217;m sharing also have companion blog posts to go with them because they are very big questions or very big features, very big plugin kind of things that we&#8217;re looking at. And so you&#8217;ll be able to find those in the show notes, or you can go to wordpress.org/news if you&#8217;re listening to this in a podcast player of your choice that is not wordpress.org.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:10]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first one on my list is a new plugin. It is called Create Block Theme. And it&#8217;s gonna make it easier for theme builders to use the existing site editor tools to create new block themes. I&#8217;m very excited about this. Uh, you can find it on make.wordpress.org/themes. And I will also include a link to it in the show notes below.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If themes are not your area of expertise, but you are interested in documentation or the DevHub or to an extent design things, then the improvements that are being worked on for the DevHub are definitely in your area. That&#8217;s kind of a Meta task, but has a few other pieces involved as well. That can be found on make.wordpress.org/meta. But again, I will have a link to the very, very detailed blog post in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s got a bunch of hypothetical changes that are being suggested for the WordPress developer docs, uh, especially when it comes to the function reference. And so there are gonna be some slight design questions, but not like, graphic design/visual design, more in the like, can humans read this design area of things? And so that will be a good one to look at. If you are sort of in the Meta or Documentation vein of things in the way that you like to contribute to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:011:30]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final thing is about open sourcing theme designs. So open sourcing everything obviously is important to us. And the design tool that we use, this tool called Figma, is open to the public. And so it&#8217;s possible for folks to be able to kind of get in there and use and reuse any design elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there&#8217;s a discussion happening over on make.wordpress.org/design about how that can and should look in the future. And so if design is definitely your area, and again, this kind of lines up with themes a little bit, then wander over into that one, for which there will also be a link in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13132\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"The Month in WordPress – June 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/07/the-month-in-wordpress-june-2022/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 06 Jul 2022 14:19:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"month in wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13069\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:313:\"With WordPress 6.1 already in the works, a lot of updates happened during June.

The potential and power of blogs would be an influence in the rest of his life.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/leo-gopal.jpeg?fit=720%2C960&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Leo sat in front of a pond. \" class=\"wp-image-13027\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/leo-gopal.jpeg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/leo-gopal.jpeg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As Leo&#8217;s confidence grew through expressing himself in writing, he was determined that his stutter would &#8216;no longer hold power over him&#8217;. In 2005, with the encouragement of his blog readers, he spent his school summer break in his room working on reducing his stutter. WordPress would be the tool that would enable him to connect with his blog readers and to express his creativity and thoughts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Making WordPress your own</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In high school, Leo had opted for programming as one of his subjects. In 2008, he built his first website using WordPress for the students at the school. This was the first time he saw the real value of WordPress and open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the following years, he increasingly spent time searching online for information on &#8216;Customising WordPress&#8217; and &#8216;Making WordPress your own&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo wanted to keep busy and as soon as he finished school, he applied for every entry-level web-related job that he could find. He was hired by a company for the role of webmaster for its Marketing team focused on WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He continued to grow his skills as a WordPress developer with the help of useful documentation that he could find and through his helpful local WordPress Community. This helped him earn a living and support his family.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Helping yourself through helping others in the community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, Leo moved full-time to Cape Town, South Africa, and started as a developer at a web development agency, eventually progressing to its Head of Development and managing a small team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He chose WordPress as his main platform for development mainly because of the community behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“<em>Had it not been for those searches on how to make WordPress your own, my life would have turned out a lot differently</em>.”&nbsp;</p><cite>Leo Gopal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo felt he had a hurdle to overcome working in web sector. He didn’t feel like a ‘real developer’ being self-taught. However, through the community, he realized that there were many self-taught developers and he was not alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside his development path, Leo faced a mental health journey. He had suffered from depression and found the community to be accepting and understanding of this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At WordCamp Cape Town 2016, he stood in front of an audience and gave a talk: “<a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2016/11/24/leo-gopal-the-wordpress-community-mental-wellness-and-you/\">The WordPress Community, Mental Wellness, and You</a>”. Following this talk, he was greeted by many attendees who thanked him for talking so openly about mental health issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Leo speaking at the podium at WordCamp Cape Town in 2016\" class=\"wp-image-13023\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Leo speaking at a WordCamp</em> Cape Town, 2016</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo has been diagnosed with bipolar, previously known as manic depression. In 2017, he hit a low period and struggled to keep going. He found support and understanding in the community in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has openly written about his experiences with depression and started an initiative where topics of mental health and general wellbeing can be freely and non-judgmentally discussed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said that by helping others, he is helping himself, every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributing to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo has contributed to the community as a Co-organizer in South Africa for the 2016 and 2017 WordCamp Cape Town, WordPress Meetup Cape Town 2015 &#8211; 2016, and WordPress Durban 2017 – 2020. He has also spoken at a number of WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintaining connections with people he had met through these events Leo felt was a great aid to his mental wellbeing during the Covid pandemic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has contributed to core and plugins and believes that WordPress and its community make it extremely easy to contribute. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“<em>The cost to start contributing is extremely low &#8211; start now</em>”.</p><cite>Leo Gopal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>When the ability to create and add patterns to the WordPress.org library came out in 2021, Leo used it almost immediately and created a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/pattern/call-to-action-section-2/\">call-to-action box</a> which could be used by both his clients and the community. He plans to release a few more complex patterns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Yes, we can.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo’s mantra is “I can do it!”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Leo speaking at a WordCamp Cape Town in 2019\" class=\"wp-image-13032\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?w=1944&amp;ssl=1 1944w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Leo speaking at a WordCamp</em> Cape Town, 2019</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting over a stutter, overcoming poverty, being urgently self-taught, growing up in a country with “load shedding” electricity outages, and one of the slowest rated internet speeds in the developing world, and strengthening mental wellness are not easy feats., And yet, he knows he can do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“<em>Never, ever think you do not have the &#8216;right&#8217; circumstances for success.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right my friends. So it&#8217;s been about a month since WordPress 6.0 came out and you know what that means. It means we are already looking at the next major WordPress release because,&nbsp; as most of you know, WordPress never sleeps. Y&#8217;all are honestly up and hustling like 24/7 as far as I can tell, which is great! And is one of the many benefits of being a global community, I suppose.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:05]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But anyway, back to this major release. There was a high-level roadmap shared by Mattias Ventura at the start of June. And it lists some focus areas for the Block Editor, continued refinements to the template editor and navigation block, and some work on global styles and more / better blocks and design tools that are slated to ship with WordPress 6.1. From the WordPress core side, though, there are a couple hundred tickets that are milestoned for the next major.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being milestoned for a release means that either a ticket wasn&#8217;t ready for the last release and was moved to the next available one, or a ticket has become ready for a release since the last major release occurred. That list as it stands might be a little bit too big for a single release. However, honestly, no list is too big if we have enough folks contributing.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you&#8217;ve never contributed to a major release of WordPress before, and you&#8217;re interested to know how that works, there are some things to keep an eye out for over the next few weeks. We are in what is considered the planning phase for the next big release. And so there are two or three things you&#8217;re gonna see pretty soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:11]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First is a planning kickoff post. That post gets published on make.wordpress.org/core, and it includes notes on volunteering for the release squad, some guesses at areas of focus based on the tickets that we&#8217;re seeing in track, a schedule, the whole kit, and caboodle. It&#8217;s all in there. If you are wanting to know how to lend a hand and how to take your first steps to core contribution, apart from the new contributor meeting that happens before the dev chat, that post is the place to start.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So keep an eye out on make.wordpress.org/core for that. And then the second thing that shows up in the planning phase for any major release is bug scrub and ticket triage meetings. Like I mentioned, there are the new contributor meetings where they scrub tickets and talk through the basics of what we&#8217;re seeing on good first bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I mentioned that here often, I just mentioned it in the last, in the last bullet point, but there are also regular bug scrubs and ticket triaging sessions where a kind contributor chooses a set of tickets to review and then leads other contributors through the process of checking to see if a ticket is valid to see if it can be replicated to see if it has a patch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:03:23]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there are decisions that are blocking it and how to move those decisions forward, and generally just kind of discuss what else has to be done in order to take the ticket to the next step. Those get announced in the dev chat every Wednesday, but also there is a post that will go up on make.wordpress.org/core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wish I had a faster way to say that instead of just racing through the whole URL every time. But it&#8217;ll be okay. We&#8217;ll put it in the show notes in case you would rather just click some stuff. And the third thing to keep an eye out for. If development is not your thing, so writing code is not already part of your tool belt, that&#8217;s totally fine. There are many other important areas where you can contribute, too. Design, training, support, polyglots, marketing, documentation, and more. These teams all do work in and around a release that is vital to WordPress&#8217; overall success.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:04:19]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a final thought of all. If that felt a little too intense if you want to see where this ship is headed, but you can&#8217;t quite commit to grabbing an oar today, that&#8217;s fine, too. The most important thing is that if you are a member of the community, as an extender or a user or a die-hard contributor, or a new contributor, the most important thing is that you have some general awareness of what the overall direction is.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might do that by experimenting with blocks in your products or by testing screen readers against your workflow or even by setting aside an hour to participate in the latest testing prompt. Being aware of what&#8217;s happening in and around your area of the project will help to keep you kind of prepared and knowledgeable to lend a hand whenever it is that you are ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:05:14]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that then brings us to our small list of big things. My friends, registration is now open for the WordPress Speaker Workshop for Women Voices in India. That&#8217;s taking place on September 24th and 25th. Uh, it&#8217;s happening over Zoom, so location or travel shouldn&#8217;t really be an obstacle for you. I&#8217;m going to leave a link to some information about that in the show notes. It should be an excellent opportunity that [the] WP Diversity initiative that WordPress has, that the community team helps to foster, is really an excellent experience. And so I hope that you register and attend that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the second thing actually is a bit of a celebration. The Photo Directory recently hit a huge milestone of 3000 photos! And you also can submit your photos to wordpress.org/photos. If you feel so inclined to make a contribution of that type.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:06:07]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing on my smallest of big things is actually kind of a, a WordPress tooltip a little bit of a WordPress project did-ya-know? So, there is a special channel in WordPress Slack for sharing thanks to folks who were especially helpful to you. It&#8217;s called the Props Channel. And when someone shares props with you, it even shows up in your activity on your wordpress.org profile. Pretty cool, huh? Props to the Meta team for that one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13013\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"WP Briefing: Episode 33: Some Important Questions from WCEU\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/06/episode-33-some-important-questions-from-wceu/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 11:01:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"wp-briefing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=13005\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:165:\"WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden Chomphosy covers some important questions from WordCamp Europe on this special episode of the WordPress Briefing podcast. \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:9:\"enclosure\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:3:\"url\";s:60:\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/WP-Briefing-033.mp3\";s:6:\"length\";s:1:\"0\";s:4:\"type\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Santana Inniss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13788:\"\n<p>In the thirty-third episode of the WordPress Briefing, hear Josepha Haden Chomphosy recap important questions from WordCamp Europe, and a selection of Contributor Day interviews. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Have a question you&#8217;d like answered?

It&#8217;s a big part of our business. And I think it&#8217;s like WordPress is a big part of all the hosting company, company’s, businesses, you know? So for us, it is like, we want to make it better. We want to give back. We want to understand, you know, where we can contribute the most. And we see it as a, you know, win, win, win situation for everyone, for clients, for the whole ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for us as a business, of course!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Milana Cap </strong>00:00:32]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite WordPress component is WP CLI. That&#8217;s my crush, haha, because I love terminal. I love doing it. I&#8217;m not a really UI type of person, I get lost in UI. But in terminal, you just type command and it does what you want. And a WP CLI is much more powerful than WordPress dashboard. You can do so many things there and you can have fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, so that&#8217;s my go-to tool!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:10]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello everyone. And welcome to the WordPress Briefing– the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:36]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many, many people were at WordCamp Europe a couple of weeks ago. And at the end, Matt and I closed out the event sessions with a little question and answer time from the community. I was excited to see everyone and excited to answer their questions. But as with all spur of the moment answers, I experienced this <em>l&#8217;esprit de l&#8217;escalier </em>and I found that there were a few things that I would have answered a little more completely if I had taken more than two seconds to think about them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So today I&#8217;m going to augment some of the answers from that session with a little more context and clarity. There was a question from Laura Byrne about favorite blocks in recent WordPress releases. And given that I was exclusively holding WordCamp Europe information in my brain at the time, I couldn&#8217;t think of which block was my favorite. While I was sitting there on that stage,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I realized that one of my favorite things about WordPress’s 6.0 release, like Matt, wasn&#8217;t really a block, but it was a functional workflow sort of thing. So my favorite thing was the ability to lock blocks, but I mean, the question was about favorite blocks. And so I do know that some of the most anticipated blocks are the Flexbox layout blocks. Whew. What a sentence!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:46]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try to say that three times fast! Those blocks are the Flexbox layout blocks, they are sort of shortcuts that show up when you&#8217;re selecting multiple blocks and allow for easy side-by-side layouts. I&#8217;m not explaining it in a way that does it much justice, but I will share a link in the show notes that has more information and you can kind of see how empowering that particular block is in the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next question I wanted to give a little more context to came from Courtney Robertson. She asked about how to make translated content more readily available on learn.wordpress.org. My answer was pretty far ranging and talked about why it&#8217;s harder to commit to prioritizing that over, for my example, translating WordPress core.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also understand that there are people who want to help and just need someone to point them in the right direction. And so I want to be clear that it is possible to have workshops in any language on learn.wordpress.org right now. We just don&#8217;t have a lot of people contributing those translations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are conversations going on right now in the training team about using Glotpress on learn.wordpress.org, and also how to translate subtitles. So, if you are looking for ways to give back through translation and training is an important kind of area of your focus. I will have links to both of those things in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:04:11]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also gave a quick answer, uh, after this question about how hard it is to recognize contributions that are separate from a major event or major release. In this case, when I say recognize, that&#8217;s recognized as in thank, not recognize as in, know it exists. In case it&#8217;s not clear why that was connected, why that answer was connected to the question, training materials are self-serve and not always specific to individual releases of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that means the maintenance of any content around training happens routinely over the course of time, rather than because of a specific release or a WordCamp. What sometimes can make it a little harder to entice people to join us in that work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now the third question I&#8217;d like to tackle is the one that came from Megan Rose. She asked how we can encourage better diversity as we go back to in-person events. My answer was more about the big picture, program-wide work that has been done and specific awarenesses that I, as a leader, have been keeping top of mind. That answer is still true and is still important, but again, it doesn&#8217;t really help anyone who&#8217;s wondering how they can show up today in their own communities, and do the hard work of fostering an inclusive space there so that we can confidently welcome more diverse voices together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:05:27]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great place to start is to have conversations with people who aren&#8217;t like you and really listen. Also recognizing that we all come from different backgrounds that give us more or less opportunity and always be asking yourself, who is missing from this conversation and why, how can I find them and invite them into our own WordPress spaces?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that all kind of feels right up your alley, I would check out the show notes. I&#8217;ll have some links in there to the community team’s site, as well as a few posts that will help you to explore that a bit further as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were also a couple of questions about market share slash usage of WordPress, and Five for the Future that I really do want to answer, but as I was writing up the context and just kind of exploring the questions that people were raising, it turned out to really be quite a big set of answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I will do those in either two separate episodes of their own or one surprisingly long, for me, episode. And so there you have it, a lightning round, deep dive on a few questions from WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Jonathan Desrosiers </strong>00:06:41]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s definitely great to be back in person. Um, it&#8217;s been a long two years, two or three years for a lot of people and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s great that we&#8217;re such an asynchronous community and we can all stay connected online through Slack and different means. Um, but there are some things that you can&#8217;t replace, like making friends with people and learning people&#8217;s demeanors and having some discussions in person that you can&#8217;t replace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, uh, I&#8217;m really excited to see people I haven&#8217;t seen in a long time. Meet new people and, um, you know, have some of those discussions here today in Portugal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:07:21]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which then brings us to our small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you missed the announcement, WordCamp Europe will be in Athens next year. And the call for organizers is open already. It&#8217;s an experience that is absolutely irreplaceable. So I&#8217;ll link to that in the show notes, in case you&#8217;ve always wanted to give back to WordPress that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on my list is that work on the next major release of WordPress is already underway. There is a post with roadmap info that was published recently, as well as a slightly more casual thread on Twitter. I&#8217;ve linked both of those in the show notes, so that you have some concept of what it is that we are aiming for in 6.1, and also a concept of where to go to get started working on it if that&#8217;s what you feel like doing, uh, for the next three to four months– 120 days, roughly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, and finally. This is less of like a thing to be aware of in the next two weeks and kind of a little WordPress project tool tip. Did you know that we have a calendar that shows all meetings for all teams all week long? It will make you feel tired by the amount of work that gets done in the WordPress project every week, but it&#8217;s right there on make.wordpress.org/meetings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you never have to wonder where folks are meeting to talk about things ever again. And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Santana Inniss &amp; Héctor Prieto </strong>00:09:11]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello!

She recalls: “No one thought to say, ‘Dee, you look like you’re good at this, you should pursue it…’. I mean, I was a girl (and I was told girls didn’t ‘do’ computers). No one in the circles I moved in really had any idea where this technology revolution would take us.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With no particular career path into technology, Dee was encouraged in her final year of school to apply for a job in a bank where she worked and became a teller three years later. She gained financial independence, which enabled her to travel as a 20-year-old and spend the next three years exploring the US and Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, she noted how the world had changed: the first computer mouse she had seen had come out in 1983, and 20 years later WordPress was founded.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Journey into coding</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During those 20 years, Dee worked as a nanny, working in child care centers, in customer support, and as a temp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1999, she packed up her bags once again, and moved from New Zealand to Australia. She took a place at a performing arts school where she honed her singing and performance skills and volunteered her time to the music director who was starting to experiment with sending out HTML newsletters and updates via email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And so my personal revolution began. On the day after I graduated from that course, I walked into a full-time role as that music director’s assistant and began my journey back to code.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of that job, Dee edited and sent HTML newsletters on a weekly basis. This ignited her interest in programming, and she bought books about coding for the web and experimented on her home-built PC making web pages. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>“I’m sure, like a lot of us, I remember the thrill of creating that first HTML file and seeing a ‘Hello World’ or similar heading rendered in the browser. From there, I was completely hooked.”</p>\n<cite>Dee Teal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Later she moved to the IT department and took on maintenance of all the websites. By 2004, she was working full-time as a webmaster. A year later, she was running a small business creating sites on the side. Four years after that, her business became her full-time job as she left employment to pursue her Masters Degree in Digital Communication and Culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Dee with other contributors getting things ready for a WordCamp\" class=\"wp-image-12961\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Dee and other volunteers setting up for a local WordCamp</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee found the theory and sociology behind the web, and its facilitation of human and machine communication fascinating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I love the fact that the tech industry involves a constant constant curve of growth and discovery, which results in a perpetual exercise in finding creative elegant solutions for sticky problems.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Dee, being able to use her innate curiosity to leverage processes, people, and tools, fuelled by a focus on communicating a message, has been a defining inspiration in her work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This combined fascination coincided with her meeting WordPress in 2009 and subsequently its community. She moved her existing blog to the software and it became the CMS of choice for all her client work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The WordPress community can change your world</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2011, she stumbled across WordCamps and by extension the WordPress community. Dee has reflected publicly that WordPress didn’t change her life, its community changed her world!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She flew on a whim from her then home in Sydney to attend a WordCamp in Melbourne she had found after a search for ‘WordPress Conferences’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I met welcoming people, made friends, connected, and came back home excited and hopeful about continuing this connection with the wider WordPress community.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a community locally around WordPress got off to a slow start in Sydney. From an inauspicious early WordPress Sydney meetup in the function room of a pub, her connection and involvement took off. Before long she was helping organize that meetup, and by the time she moved away from that great city it had branched into two meetups, and soon after, into three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was so inspired by the community that at the end of that first year and her second WordCamp, she raised her hand to help organize a WordCamp Sydney in 2012, and after moving interstate, WordCamp Melbourne in 2013.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;WordPress and any other software package exist to serve people.&#8221;</p>\n<cite>Dee Teal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee said: “WordPress, software, technology, the Internet will come and go, morph, and change, evolve. Maybe WordPress will last forever, maybe it will morph into something else, maybe one day it will look completely different than it did when I first started (actually, that’s true now). The thing that doesn’t change is the humanity around it. WordPress and any other software package exist to serve people.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added: “The thing that I have learned, not only through WordPress but in life, is that if we too serve the people around what we’re doing, we ourselves will grow, develop and change alongside the people we serve, and the tools we use to serve them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"329\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=1024%2C329&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Dee pictured second from left as part of the WordPress 5.6 contributors\" class=\"wp-image-12957\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=1024%2C329&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=300%2C96&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=768%2C246&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Some of the contributors to the <em>WordPress 5.6 release</em> </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee was a coordinator for WordPress 5.6 release in 2020 and was able to encourage others to learn about the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Helping others and sharing knowledge through WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee has been an advocate for cross-cultural collaboration and understanding in both WordPress and her work for a large distributed agency which has people from more than 24 countries and operates across 16 timezones.

It’s those connections, it’s the friendships. It’s the network of work, referrals, support, help, encouragement that has kept me wired into this community and committed to helping other people find that connection and growth for themselves.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee’s career in WordPress has moved through coding, into project management of large scale WordPress projects, and now into delivery leadership. Her connections to community have helped &#8216;fuel the transitions&#8217; through these chapters of her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I believe that the place I’ve found and the opportunities I have had owe as much to my own desire and ambition as they do to the help, support and belief of the community around me; sometimes even more than I’ve felt in myself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She feels that she is ‘living proof’ that by helping, connecting, and resourcing other people, you can be helped, resourced and connected into places you had never thought possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has enabled her to reach and have a career in technology that she did not know existed as a teenager playing with that first computer mouse and experimenting with code. Dee hopes her story will inspire others in their journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>), Meher Bala (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>meher</a>), Chloe Bringmann (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a>), Nalini Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>nalininonstopnewsuk</a>), and Larissa Murillo (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>lmurillom</a>) for work on this feature.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it. As well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the approach of various mid-year breaks and the prospect of wandering off for some safe, restorative travel, I&#8217;ve been updating my to-read and re-read list. As I was looking at the queued books for my Northern hemisphere summer, there were some common threads, mostly around leadership, but there&#8217;s also like a chunk that&#8217;s about cross-cultural group theory and economics, and then like some beach reads, but there&#8217;s one group in particular that you all might find interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s a group that&#8217;s sort of like a back-to-FOSS basics list. So I&#8217;ll share my top few with you in case you want to pack a copy for your next getaway.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one on our list is called Producing Open Source Software by Karl Fogel. I think everyone who contributes to FOSS projects has received this as one of their first recommendations. Like, y&#8217;all are building open software? Excellent, you need to read Producing Open Source Software. Like, that is just a sentence that comes out of everyone&#8217;s mouths. So this was one of the first open source books that was recommended to me when I joined the WordPress community. It was freshly revised in 2020, and I haven&#8217;t given it a read since then, which is why it is on my reread list this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it shaped the early days of the WordPress project’s leadership, and their lead developers, and some of WordPress&#8217;s basic philosophies. It&#8217;s all available online, under a creative commons, ShareAlike license. And so it&#8217;s worth the read. I&#8217;ll put a link to it in the show notes so it&#8217;s easy for everyone to find in the event that is your preferred beach read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one on this list is a book from Nadia Eghbal. She wrote the excellent Roads and Bridges report that also is probably not light beach reading, but you know, this one is on my list to read this summer because Eghbal always delivers truths about the reality of maintaining popular software, popular, open source software, in a way that&#8217;s easy for me to access and process rather than getting paralyzed by the enormity of it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For what it&#8217;s worth your mileage may vary on that. I realized that, like, I live and breathe open source stuff. And so just because I am not paralyzed by the enormity of her explanations of things doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that you will have a similar experience. And so I&#8217;m just going to claim that elephant in the room for all of us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you only read one book on this list this year, I think that this should be the one that you read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:14]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third one is called Code: Collaborative Ownership and the Digital Economy. It was edited by Rishab Aiyer Ghosh. I am certain that I butchered that name. And so I apologize on my own behalf to everyone that knows whether or not I said it correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This book focuses on intellectual property rights and the original purpose of having anything like copyright in the world. So, right up my alley! The writers who contributed to this work promise exploration of the plight of creativity in the commons, the role of sharing in creative advancement, and a concept of what it would look like if intellectual property were to mean the second closing of an ecosystem versus a triumph of the commons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, obviously, this one is very light reading. You can take this topic to high tea and everyone will not know what you&#8217;re talking about. However, this one looks like a really interesting book to me and I am just super ready to read it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:19]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second to last one on the list is a book called Humble Inquiry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a new-to-me book that seems right in line with one of my favorite books to recommend to leaders in the open source space. From reviews of it, I have gathered that it takes a hard look at the value of listening and asking for clarification in a world that puts a high value on an unsolicited hot take.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It puts the importance of high trust relationship building, which is at the heart of any cross-culturally aware organization. And for folks who&#8217;ve been working with me for a while, you know, that relationship building is an important part of my leadership expectations for myself. So it puts relationship building at the front and center with a promise of practical applications for everyday life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you ever have tried to tackle a complicated topic like this, you know that practical applications are really hard to come by and it&#8217;s often hard to understand it if you don&#8217;t have those practical applications. And so that is why this one is on my read and reread list this year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:24]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then finally the WordPress Milestones book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this sounds like a shameless plug for WordPress. And on the one hand, this whole podcast is about WordPress. And so, yes! But on the other hand, I actually am reading this for two specific reasons. I&#8217;m rereading this actually. I read it when I first joined Automattic. And so the first of the two reasons that I&#8217;m rereading it this year is that volume two of this is, like the second decade of WordPress currently, being researched and written in preparation for WordPress’s 20th birthday next year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I am rereading this to kind of get that all back in my mind as that work is getting done. And the second reason is that I honestly like to remind myself of how far we&#8217;ve come sometimes. I talk about our work frequently. And I talk about what we&#8217;re working on right now, all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I talk about what we&#8217;re looking at three years from now, five years from now. The biggest concerns of today, tomorrow, and the future-future. And it&#8217;s very easy to forget how much success WordPress has had and how much growth the contributors that support us have had over the course of our long and storied history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:40]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I like to go back to that just to kind of give myself some grounding in our progress, as well as get some concept for how we can move forward together. So that one is also available online. Also under a creative commons ShareAlike license and it is also worth the read. I will share a link to that with the other one in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. Let&#8217;s see what we got in the old lineup today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, firstly WordCamp Europe is happening this week and it&#8217;s possible to watch the live stream from the comfort of your own home. There are some smart and talented speakers at the event. So I encourage you to catch a few if you have the time. I&#8217;ll include a link to the live stream information in the show notes below, and then also you can always keep an eye out on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be a lot of discussions, a lot of conversation there. And so you can engage with folks that are there at the time and catch up on those conversations, catch up on those presentations in your own time, as it fits into your day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:50]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that WordPress’s community team is preparing the annual meetup survey right now. So if you participate in meetup events, keep an eye out for that because your feedback helps us to make plans to improve that program so that it works better for you. And it helps you to learn WordPress better and feel more confident with what you are taking out into the world that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, if you are wanting to use this as a chance to contribute, we actually will need folks who are able to translate the surveys as well. So I&#8217;ll leave a link to some information about that in the show notes. If all of that stuff about contribution didn&#8217;t make any sense, then just like keep an eye out from your meetup organizer and they will make sure that you have that survey so that you can have your voice heard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:33]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then item three is less of an item. I mean, it&#8217;s an item cause it&#8217;s in this list, but it&#8217;s less of, like, a thing to know and more of a general thing to be aware of. It&#8217;s a general awareness item. There&#8217;s a lot going on in WordPress right now. I can see how hard it is to keep track of some of these things these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know as someone who&#8217;s looking at this all day every day that, yeah, it&#8217;s a lot. And it&#8217;s hard to get your bearings. So if you have a team that you contribute to already, don&#8217;t forget to reach out to each other, just to check-in. Sometimes we don&#8217;t think to ask for help. Sometimes we don&#8217;t think to offer help and you know, if no one needs any help from you at that moment, a little hello also can brighten someone&#8217;s day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your smallest of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12940\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}s:27:\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\";a:1:{s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:4:\"href\";s:32:\"https://wordpress.org/news/feed/\";s:3:\"rel\";s:4:\"self\";s:4:\"type\";s:19:\"application/rss+xml\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:44:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/\";a:2:{s:12:\"updatePeriod\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"\n	hourly	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:15:\"updateFrequency\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"\n	1	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:4:\"site\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"14607090\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:9:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 20:03:20 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:34:\"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8\";s:25:\"strict-transport-security\";s:11:\"max-age=360\";s:6:\"x-olaf\";s:3:\"⛄\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 15:43:59 GMT\";s:4:\"link\";s:63:\"<https://wordpress.org/news/wp-json/>; rel=\"https://api.w.org/\"\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 2\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20221028170402\";}', 'no');

Truyền thông Anh cho biết Ronaldo sẽ có cơ hội thi đấu trong trận tới, sau khi bị kỷ luật ở đại chiến hoà Chelsea hôm 22/10.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ronaldo&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vnexpress.net/ronaldo-bi-loai-khoi-tran-chelsea-4526026.html\">bị cách ly</a>&nbsp;khỏi đội một Man Utd năm ngày, kể từ khi anh&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vnexpress.net/ronaldo-tu-choi-vao-san-tran-tottenham-4526043.html\">từ chối vào sân</a>&nbsp;và&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vnexpress.net/ronaldo-bo-ve-som-khi-khong-duoc-thi-dau-4525588.html\">bỏ về sớm</a>&nbsp;ở trận thắng Tottenham hôm 19/10. Một ngày sau đó, HLV Erik ten Hag mạnh tay cấm Ronaldo chơi trận gặp Chelsea. Ronaldo tập riêng kể từ đó, nhưng vẫn thường xuyên trao đổi với HLV người Hà Lan. Ten Hag được cho là hài lòng với thái độ của Ronaldo sau khi bị kỷ luật, nên anh có thể lại thi đấu cùng đội một.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ronaldo mới đá chính hai trong 11 trận của Man Utd ở Ngoại hạng Anh mùa này. Nhưng tại Europa League, anh đá chính cả bốn trận, ghi một bàn và kiến tạo một bàn khác. Man Utd đã gần như chắc suất vào vòng 1/16, nhưng vẫn cần cạnh tranh đứng đầu bảng E để vào thẳng vòng 1/8.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Trong trận hoà Chelsea, Man Utd khan hiếm tiền đạo khi nhìn vào các quyết định thay người của Ten Hag. Dù đội nhà chiếm ưu thế, Ten Hag phải đưa Fred vào thay Jadon Sancho, rồi Anthony Elanga thế chỗ Marcus Rashford. Điều đó khiến sức công của Man Utd suy giảm trong hiệp hai. Họ chỉ&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vnexpress.net/man-utd-hoa-chelsea-phut-94-4526776.html\">thoát thua</a>&nbsp;nhờ cú đánh đầu gỡ hoà 1-1 của Casemiro phút 94.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Bàn duy nhất của Ronaldo ở Europa League mùa này ghi từ phạt đền&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vnexpress.net/ronaldo-ghi-ban-dau-tien-o-europa-league-4511915.html\">gặp chính Sheriff</a>&nbsp;tại Moldova hôm 15/9. Lần này Man Utd có lợi thế chơi trên sân Old Trafford, nhưng họ có thể phải giữ sức cho trụ cột trước trận gặp West Ham ở Ngoại hạng Anh ngày 30/10.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'Ronaldo trở lại tập cùng Man Utd', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '68-revision-v1', '', '', '2022-10-28 20:57:45', '2022-10-28 20:57:45', '', 68, 'http://localhost/wordpress/?p=74', 0, 'revision', '', 0);
